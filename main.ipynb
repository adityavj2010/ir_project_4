While Democrats (and left-leaning independents) represent a majority, or at least a plurality, in the US, the Republicans are kicking our ass due gerrymandering and the way the Senate works. The Repubs have indicated that they will not honor established norms (e.g. the appointment, or lack thereof, of two Supreme Court justices that should have gone to a Democrat; the insistence that the 2020 election was stolen from them). They lie with impunity and then double down when called on it, which only increases their credibility in the eyes of their ~~thralls~~ supporters. They are installing faithful allies in local election precincts that could potentially allow them to do what Trump failed to; overturn the results of an election. Meanwhile, indications are good that we will lose both the House and Senate in 2022. \\n\\nMy question here is: what is being done about this? What can we do? I, personally, am a nobody; I’ve never held or even run for any sort of public office, and don’t have the charisma to do it even if I wanted to. But I don’t see any indications that the Democratic Party is taking these issues seriously. Or maybe I’m not seeing anything because I live in a safely Democratic state? ISTM the only way to counteract Republican gerrymandering is with Democratic gerrymandering in blue states, and I don’t see that this is happening anywhere. I’m scared shitless that once the Republicans get back in power, they will do anything they can to remain there.',\n",

I'm now at a point where I feel like the fundamental of democracy (that everyone can vote) is the problem.\\n\\nI followed the US election reasonably closely - and was obviously shocked. A slimy salesman managed to convince the majority of the population that he was the right man for the job (well, not actually the majority, but that's a whole nother fucked up thing that makes no sense to me, but that system is not true democracy) - when it was glaringly obvious to anyone with half a degree of critical thought that he was nothing more than a salesman with absolutely no substance (not to mention the destructive and poorly thought out policies).\\n\\nNow here in NZ, we're coming up to our election, and the same shit is going on (to a much less intense degree). The population is, generally speaking, not interested in voting based on what's actually important - realistic, achievable policies that will make the nation a better place. People actively sneer at such a concept... Instead, from what I've seen, people are far more likely to vote based on the following reasons:\\n\\n1) They'll blindly vote for who they voted for last election - for no other reason than that.\\n\\n2) They'll vote for which ever leader personally appeals to them most - the best salesman.\\n\\n3) They'll vote for the one who's name is most known - advertising.\\n\\n4) Some will actually vote for the party with the policies that appeal to them most - but they almost never actually look critically at the policy to see how realistic it is.\\n\\nNone of these votes are useful when it comes to selecting the best people to lead - yet they form the vast majority.\\n\\nDemocracy, it seems to me, will always be doomed to this failure, due to the nature of human minds - though despite this failure, it seems far more robust and resistant to the abuse of power than all the other systems of governance (unless there are some good ones out there that I haven't heard of).\\n\\nAm I butting my head against a wall?

Using *random samples* of the public not only makes it workable, but even makes representation statically measurable; I’ll be referring to these bodies as **samples**. This is the future of democracy!\\n\\nHere are a few points of improvement over the status quo and ways of implementing this form of direct democracy.\\n\\n**Diversity:** Samples, being randomly selected, would make sure women, minorities, and opinions would have proportional representation in our democracy.\\n\\n**Voter Turnout:** We have low turnout in our most exciting election the presidency, and voter turnout for everything else is so much worse. This is so bad that it puts our status as a democracy, at all, in question. Samples guarantee virtual 100% turnouts every time.\\n\\n**Cost &amp; Speed:** The cost of having a sample vote on a topic is much smaller and can happen faster and more often than a popular general vote.\\n\\n**Direct Democracy:** Powers such as referendum, initiative, and recall would gain real teeth in the hands of a sample designed for increased oversight. This assumes a non-legislature sample empowered with these powers in place of the general public.\\n\\n**Corruption:** Being randomly selected samples aren’t given money to get into their position, and so don’t have to please anyone but the public.\\n\\n**Non-Partisan:** Samples can be trusted to do things legislatures can’t be trusted to do. They don’t have an incentive to **gerrymander** and if a state constitution needs rewriting I would prefer there to be no party, political, or money interest getting in the way of the public good.\\n\\n**Implementing:** States and political parties have the most legal flexibility to implement these samples. The electoral college and primaries would be the easiest to make samples. Primaries would be the very easiest way of implementation.\\n\\n**Primaries:** Political parties could use the samples to improve their primaries for all levels of government including presidential primaries. A State could get rid of parties altogether replacing them with non-party sample primaries, finally including independents in primaries, with the sample choosing double the candidates as seats available for the final general election.\\n\\n**Sample Elections:** We could replace general elections with samples dedicated to holding elections for all or some elected positions.\\n\\n**Sample legislature:** This is ambitious plan to replace our elected legislatures with sample legislatures. Although Article 1, section 4 of the constitution and the 14th amendment might prevent this one as they assume elections.\\n\\nThese ideas are based on the idea of *sortition*, so I recommend looking into it. It is democracy through random selection. I’d love feedback, and if you know of an legal hurdles please let me know!',\n",

       " {'selftext': \"This is in a nutshell how I feel about democracy. \\n\\nFirst, most people do not take political issues for what they are: issues. If people actually approached each issue as a problem and set out to solve it, I would have some confidence in democracy. However, it seems that people have a predisposition to make political decisions in a certain way (without thinking about it). This eventually leads to a political system that makes most of its decisions without spending more than 10 minutes thinking about them.\\n\\nSecond, elected officials answer to what the people want, they do not use their agency to the progress of the country. What we see instead, is a bunch of savvy manipulators and rhetoricians that give the people exactly what they want, all of the time. Their job is not as litigator or executive. Their job is crowd control, people pleasing, and antagonizing their opponents.\\n\\nFinally, democracy is an easy thing to buy: especially post-citizens united. This is kind of where the two other reasons why democracy sucks come together. So most people are not only too stupid to really think through problems and come up with solutions, but the other side is feeding them 'information' on how they should make decisions. Take, for example, the recent ads from the Romney and Obama campaigns. They do not present anything of substance, just antagonizing arguments based on sound-bites. I don't fucking care that Romney out-sourced employees, it has nothing to do with what he would be able to do as president. I don't care that Obama said the economy is fine once in his 4-years as president, or in his 51 years of life. Neither of these things matter at all! I do support Obama over Romney, but not because Romney outsourced workers (it was probably a good decision economically for Bane Capital). But since super-pacs can spend all of the money they want on these types of ads it's all most people will learn about each candidate. It's easy to manipulate people, and it's even easier when you have a shit load of capital backing it up.\\n\\nSo, if this post has any success, I want to hear arguments against and for democracy. I don't want to hear counter-arguments that are solely based in ideology. In a perfect world, democracy kicks ass! But the founding fathers, and Jefferson in particular (minus a few; esp. Adams), were living in a dream world of optimism and faith in humanity. I implore that we reconsider the world as it is, not as we would like it to be.\\n\\n'Democracy... while it lasts is more bloody than either aristocracy or monarchy.

It is illegal to take them out in order to save them.\\n\\nLiving in a Police State: I just rode my bike along the canal by my house and once again, saw tons of fish, dying in the sun. They\\'re draining the canals again. It\\'s hard to watch several hundred creatures gasping for \\'breath\\' and slowly fading away, so as usual I headed home and got a bucket and a cast net. I headed back to the canal and started throwing the net. I had done it about three times and had 15 or so fish in the bucket, and was about to ride to a pond and release them when I saw the police cruiser driving along the canal. Uh oh. I knew this wasn\\'t \\'legal\\' and was okay with taking my chances because I felt the moral imperative was to ease suffering without regard to the rights of some \\'corporate entity\\'. I\\'d have paid the ticket without fighting it. I was packing up to leave when he got to me. He told me (he was pretty cool about it... one of Goodyear AZ\\'s finest) to \"hold on just a minute.\" He asked how many I had, and I said 8 or 9, hoping he\\'d let me leave with such a small number. He told me it was posted no fishing. I told him I wasn\\'t fishing... I was saving fish from an agonizing death. He told me he had written 7 tickets for fishing, yesterday. I told him I wasn\\'t fishing... I was saving the fish from dying. He told me they were the property of the corporation that owned the canal. At that point I should have told him that they were neglectful in the care of their property, and that it was despicable... but I didn\\'t think of it. He told me I had to put the living fish back in the canal,,,,, with the dying fish. I said \"you want me to put them back... to die\". He said yes. You could see that he was conflicted, but at the end of the day, he surely sided with the corporation, which was in clear conflict with his morality and his conscience. So I dumped them... they bounced along the side of the canal, and back into the water, and they\\'ll die there. The pond I was going to put them in is 100 yards away. I need a beer.\\n\\nRevised - My pal John E. Williams in Arizona originally posted this on his facebook page. He did not have a reddit account at the time but I felt obligated to post it.

I've researched it myself, but I'd be thankful for anyone better educated than me lending a hand.\\n\\nThe claim is that all life on Earth will be wiped out within the near future, potentially during the next few years, due to climate change.\\n\\nIt seems to stem mostly from a circle of fringe scientists who have small but very dedicated followings on YouTube, with G McPherson at the center of it- a retired professor of natural resources who believes that all life, including microbial life, will be wiped out by 2026, or 2030 at the latest. He is not a very reliable source at all from my experience with him, in fact he kind of comes across as the Bjorn Lomborg of defeatism- and the fact that I've seen him heart comments from subscribers talking about offing their families is highly disturbing, but I have heard this idea repeated elsewhere as well.\\n\\nIt goes that we will see a 'Blue Ocean Event' either this year or next year, and that this will cause instantaneous global crop failures and societal collapse as Humanity loses all habitat. Then the loss of aerosols will cause temperatures to rise by several degrees C, wiping out the rest of Humanity, and causing all the world's Nuclear reactors to instantly meltdown irradiating the entire planet and preventing life of any kind from forming.\\n\\nThey also cite this study regarding co-extinctions, which I will link here:\\n\\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35068-1?sfns=mo](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35068-1?sfns=mo)\\n\\nThey claim it proves their belief that all life is on the brink of getting wiped out, but it doesn't seem to be suggesting that at all. It's just illustrating how extinction events pan out.\\n\\nThe fact that this hypothesis relies partly on the assumption that 99% of all scientists are in on a government conspiracy to conceal the truth and partly on scaremongering over renewable and nuclear energy, not to mention the people it's coming from, makes me intensely dubious.\\n\\nSources on the aerosol masking affect don't seem to agree on exactly how significant it is, though most don't seem to feel that it's a major source of concern. Most seem to feel that aerosols are blocking between 0.4 - 0.9 degrees C of warming, mostly on a regional level, and that this can be mitigated. Certainly they don't view it as an excuse to stay on fossil fuels.\\n\\nEven if it was so much worse though, surely it could simply be resolved by producing particles artificially while we lower greenhouse gas emissions? It really just seems like people are using it as an excuse to attack climate scientists and justify raping the atmosphere.\\n\\nOn the subject of nuclear energy, this seems like more fossil fuel propaganda to me. Are modern power plants not significantly more secure than they use to be? I'm not a nuclear shill and I recognize the potential dangers of it, but it's still so much better than coal, oil or gas. And surely we would be able to shut them down in the face of global catastrophe?\\n\\nIf there is any truth to this at all, then what do we do about it? If it's a bunch of BS made to distract from the real danger of ecological collapse and to harm activism, why are people spreading it around?\\n\\nThey don't appear to be making much money off it (though McPherson has been accused before by climatologist Michael Mann of being a fossil fuel puppet) and they seem to think that it's true. Are they trying to push a philosophy? Or are they just severely depressed and removed enough from mainstream science that they've come to think themselves superior?\",\n",

We can still limit it to 2.0 degrees C, if we take drastic action this decade. Failing that we will simply have to do our best to mitigate and adapt however much we can, though for many it will be impossible. According to Climate Action Tracker we are currently looking at between 2.4 and 4.6 (Most probably 2.6 - 3.6) degrees C by 2100; depending on variables such as the sensitivity of the Earth's systems and Human actions. \\n\\nWe need a rapid transition towards clean energy and an economic revolution starting now if we are to avoid the worst case scenarios- but we also need to prepare for the worst. While we must always strive to get close to the Paris climate targets, even if we miss them, we also need to acknowledge the very real threats that will come even if we limit warming to those implausibly low levels.\\n\\nI say this not to be a doomist, but as someone who cares a great deal for the Earth and its people.

If you don't have food or clean water, you die.

If temperatures rise by 5.0 degrees or more this century, unlikely but possible- especially if the Earth is more sensitive than we realize and we trigger a tipping point cascade, we could well have a repeat of the Permian's Great Dying on our hands.\\n\\nTo limit the loss of life as much as possible, especially in those worst case scenarios, we need plans. Hopefully the IPCC will have some worthwhile things in their upcoming report regarding adaptation and mitigation strategies, but until then it's something worth discussing.\\n\\nRewilding and regenerative agriculture I have already brought up. Sustainably powered water desalination along with aquaponics and vertical farming could also go a long way in ensuring that at least some of Humanity makes it in even the most horrific eventualities.

If it\\'s false, please watch out for it in future and help educate others if you see them repeating it. If it\\'s at least partially correct, what can be done about it?\\n\\nFrom what I can gather it mostly originated from Sam Carana (an anonymous individual who claims to be a climate scientist and who believes that over 99% of all scientists are in on a giant conspiracy to downplay climate change) and was later repeated by various figures within the defeatist communities. Most notably the retired professor of natural resources McPherson, who uses it as the basis for his belief that Humans will be extinct before 2030 and has actually stated that he feels it\\'s too conservative. \\n\\nThis seems intensely dodgy to me. It feels less like an attempt at forming a theory based on evidence, and more like an intentional slander against mainstream science by those who hold a grudge against it. \\n\\nThe assertion is that:\\n\\nA) aerosols from industrial activity are masking so much warming that a devastating heat spike will wipe out most life as soon as we leave fossil fuels. B) We passed the point of no return decades ago and now positive feedback loops, particularly Arctic methane and iceloss, are guaranteed to cause runaway warming- leading to a Venus-like scenario. C) that nuclear power plants will melt down as soon as we face major disturbances, irradiating the entire planet. D) That nearly all scientists are downplaying the environmental crisis, either because they\\'re scared or because they\\'re in on a conspiracy.\\n\\nOverall, the \"theory\" predicts an insane temperature rise of 18 degrees Celsius- possibly by 2026- and an end to all life on Earth.\\n\\nThe aerosol masking effect is a complex issue, however most scientists do not seem to view it as an apocalyptic threat. The most extreme estimate I\\'ve heard, outside self described doomist spheres, is that aerosols are masking about 1.1 degrees C of warming, with most scientists believing that it\\'s most likely 0.4 - 0.9 degrees Celsius. That\\'s not insignificant and should be addressed, but it\\'s not close to the 3.0 to 8.0 degrees C asserted in this hypothesis.\\n\\nIn any case, scientists have previously addressed the issue and have concluded that it can be mostly mitigated through enhancing natural carbon sinks and cutting back on methane.\\n\\nClaims that positive feedback loops and tipping points make Human activities redundant also seem false, and in fact seem suspiciously in line with conventional denial tactics used by corporations- who claim that climate change is caused mostly by natural phenomena. The overwhelming majority of the harm is still coming directly from Humans and that doesn\\'t seem likely to change much in the future, even with the natural mechanisms that our civilisation is currently violating.\\n\\nI do not know enough about nuclear energy to speak on it with any authority, but I have heard that it has changed a great deal since Chernobyl. It is currently considered among the least destructive and most secure forms of consistent energy, and even in the event of a meltdown It seems unlikely that 100% of the planet would be irradiated. Even if that happened, fungi can live and thrive off radiation- so the claim that all life will be gone is again very extreme and implausible.\\n\\nIf there is any truth to this claim, I would like to know- and I would like to know what we can do about it. Based on the people I\\'ve seen talking and/or hearing about it, and from my own experience of feeling overwhelmed by dread, it is anxiety inducing to the point of being paralyzing for many- though, that may well be the point of it.\\n\\nIf there is truth in it, what can be done about it?\\n\\nIf there is no truth, than I can only encourage you to remember the fact that science denial can take many forms- defeatism and conspiracy among them.\\n\\nIf I am mistaken about anything, or if this is not the place for this kind of discussion, please let me know.

It gave me a ground for understanding how the eco system works and how the climate effects are affecting the world as we know it now, like one example on this is the poles melting, how the ice is home to many animals, and what a rising sea level will cause to humans,. Also how green lands are being affected and how much deforestation has happened that is killing the earth\\'s lungs, and how the melting of the ice means more heat is being trapped in the sea. \\n\\nI also read through [The EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) that helped in understanding how the change is taking place and how the fossil fuel companies are responsible for big part of this.\\n\\nI went through all the data provided by [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/139/video-global-warming-from-1880-to-2021/) on climate change and how terrible the situation looks to be, how the highest records of temperatures were recorded only the last two decades. \\n\\nI also looked onto the [6th assessment report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) but didn\\'t understand much, as I have a hard time with scientific research since English isn\\'t my first language, but it gave the impression that we are doomed I guess?

And the fact that short term actions do not match the plans.\\n\\nThe video also explains how the GHG emissions need to be half by 2030 for the world to be brought into a 1.5°C pathway. But still the actions being taken today won\\'t achieve this target by 2030.\\n\\nThere are good news as well. The fact that renewable energy is the new normal for a new power production capacity worldwide because it\\'s cheaper, there is some transitioning to electric cars and some sectors are starting to move out of investing in fossil fuels.\\n\\nThese good news, how good are they for the climate? I mean if these things are happening does that contradict everything negative I\\'ve said above, or are the good news just not enough to combat the change, what\\'s actually needed at this point?\\n\\nBecause I have also read the article on a website called \"real climate\" and they article is titled \"[we are not reaching 1.5°C earlier than previously thought](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2021/08/we-are-not-reaching-1-5oc-earlier-than-previously-thought/), I also had a hard time understanding what I read but, every time I read more I am faced with different opinions, people saying that it\\'s not as as bad as we think, or that [the media is pushing the worst case scenarios as the truth.](https://issues.org/climate-change-scenarios-lost-touch-reality-pielke-ritchie/)\\n\\nI seriously don\\'t know what is actually going on at this point, I mean we are feeling the effects, animals are already going extinct, and the poles are melting,\\n\\n(this whole research is being done because I have a college assignment and I don\\'t know what to write anymore)',\n",

Background: I'm a behavioral neuroscientist well versed in the field of statistics. \\n\\nI've heard all about climate change and have read about it online but I have a hard time simply believing what I read because everything has become so politicized. I'm not sure whether to believe that climate change is going to end the world tomorrow or if it will never end the world. Can anybody offer proper statistical data (peer reviewed, p-value below .01, and bona fide data collection) supporting the idea of climate change? If not, maybe a book I should read that isn't absolute ideological hogwash? It's frustrating that politics have invaded the idea of climate change and I'm looking for real information and proper research to review. Thought this was the right spot to look for information.

       " {'selftext': 'First of all, let me clarify that I\\'m not a climate change skeptic. I posted a similar thread a year or so ago and it didn\\'t go well, people thought I was trying to discredit global warming, so let me state loud and clear that **I fully accept the fact that the climate is warming and that human emissions are the most likely culprit.** \\n\\nWhat I\\'d like to discuss here is the apparent similarity between modern warming and the Dansgaard-Oeschger events (I probably butchered it) that occurred during the past glaciation. \\n\\nThe NOAA website has a [page](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/paleo-perspectives/abrupt-climate-change) about abrupt climate change. I quote:\\n\\n&gt;Imagine that over the course of a decade or two, the long, snowy winters of northern New England were replaced by milder winters like those in Washington, D.C., or that a sharp decrease in rainfall turned the short-grass prairie of the western Great Plains into a desert landscape similar to Arizona. \\\\[...\\\\] These scenarios are not science fiction. Paleoclimate records indicate that climate changes of this size and speed have occurred at many times in the past.\\n\\nIt contains links to pages that go in deeper detail about various types of such instances, including Dansgaard-Oeschgerd events (I *defintely* butchered it).\\n\\nThe page about the D-O events states that there seems to be trace of multiple very rapid events of warming over the course of the last glaciation, along the lines of several degrees Celsius in a few decades, which brought the temperature to a level similar to interglacial conditions for a brief period:\\n\\n&gt; Scientists Willi Dansgaard and Hans Oeschger first reported the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events in Greenland ice cores. Each of the 25 observed D-O events consisted of an abrupt warming to near interglacial conditions that occurred in a matter of decades and was followed by a gradual cooling. \\n\\nThe article also states, reporting several academic sources from all around the world, that\\n\\n&gt; Heinrich and D-O events had a global footprint\\n\\nIt then goes on to explain that these events were not just localized to Greenland, where the most abrupt and defined changes in temperature were detected, but had repercussions all over the world. I took a look at a few of the sources cited, they\\'re crazy: pollen records in [Italy](https://www.nature.com/articles/23432), moisture proxies in [New Mexico](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo754), speleological rainfall data in [Brazil](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03365), and many others, all agree that **rapid and worldwide** fluctuations in climate (either temperature or rainfall) have occurred many times over the past 100 to 50 thousand years.\\n\\nI can\\'t help but notice the similarities between a D-O and modern anthropogenic climate change: similar speed of warming, also affects the Arctic disproportionately compared to the rest of the world, also affects the northern hemisphere more than the southern hemisphere, also influences major weather systems like the rain belt. So, setting aside the root cause (which, again, I fully accept being human emissions) and the fact that D-O events tend to subside after a few decades, which the current trend probably won\\'t unless we do something drastic about it, how do the two phenomena compare in terms of ecological and weather-related consequences? \\n\\nAm I justified, in the light of presented research, in concluding that the claim that current global warming is of \"unprecedented speed\" is just false? Why or why not?\\n\\nThank you for your time',\n",

Market forces can be leveraged to drive the bulk of global GHG emissions mitigation because the technologies required are either already commercially available and competitive today, or can be deployed to market before 2025 with the right societal choices. The same technologies will also make the cost of carbon withdrawal affordable, meaning that moonshot breakthrough technologies are not required to solve the ‘Last\\xa0Carbon Problem’ and go beyond net zero from 2035\\xa0onwards.\\n\\nKey Findings Key Implications of the Energy, Transportation, and\\xa0Food Disruptions for Climate Change\\n\\n1. We can achieve net zero emissions much more quickly than is\\xa0widely imagined by deploying and scaling the technology we\\xa0already have.\\n2. We can achieve net zero emissions without collateral damage to society or\\xa0the economy.\\n3. Markets can and must play the dominant role in reducing emissions.\\n4. Decarbonizing the global economy will not be costly, it will instead save trillions of dollars.\\n5. A focused approach to reducing emissions is better than an\\xa0all-of-the-above ‘whack-a-mole’ approach.\\n6. We no longer need to trade off the environment and the economy against each other.\\n7. The clean disruption of energy, transportation, and food will narrow rather than widen the gap between wealthy and poor communities, and developed and less-developed countries.\\n8. The same technologies that allow us to mitigate emissions will\\xa0also enable us to withdraw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere affordably.\\n9. Societal choices matter, and technology alone is not enough to\\xa0achieve net zero emissions.\\n\\nThe Age of Creation\\n\\nHumanity is on the cusp of the most profound transformation of the system of production in human history; from an extraction-based system dependent on exploiting scarce inputs (resources and labor) that requires scale and reach and centralization; to a creation-based system; a generative model that creates the things we need from super-abundant inputs available everywhere, and that is distributed, interconnected and networked. The complex problems in society, from climate change to conflict and inequality, are an inevitable outcome of this extraction-based system of production. In an extractive system, a ‘growth imperative’ is the key underlying evolutionary driver.\\n\\nCivilizations that grow their capabilities and reach the fastest, spread through conquest or mimicry. Zero-sum competition forces societies to exploit or be exploited, hardwiring environmental degradation and inequality into the system. Societies that fail to exploit people and the planet slow progress and become footnotes in history. Thus, all these problems are\\xa0at\\xa0their root an outcome of our extraction-based system of production. However, society is blind to this critical insight and the possibility of an alternative. Our reductionist, narrow, linear mindsets mean we fail to appreciate the complex processes of change driving the disruption of our production system and are hence unable to recognize the speed, scale and impact of\\xa0this\\xa0transformation.\\n\\nThis failure means we see these problems as ‘wicked’ intractable issues with no good solutions. That might be true within the framework of the incumbent system, where zero-sum trade-offs mean that\\xa0solving climate change for example, impacts economic growth; but this\\xa0is\\xa0not\\xa0the case in the emerging system, that allows us to address all our\\xa0problems together without trade-offs, as if cutting the Gordian knot.\\n\\nUnfortunately, conventional blindness to this opportunity compels us to focus our efforts on solving yesterday’s problems, by patching up the old system through ‘Band-Aid’ solutions which address the symptom not the cause. While many of these ‘Band-Aids’ have some use in holding the current system together to prevent collapse before the new system emerges, they must not be mistaken for ‘cures’. Other ‘Band-Aids,’ however, can divert valuable resources (time, attention and capital) away from the optimal interventions and even risk shutting off the route to breakthrough.\\n\\nThe impending transformation of the production system driven by disruptions across the five foundational sectors of civilization represents a phase change: a\\xa0fundamental change to the system state where all the conditions, rules and relationships are re-configured. This system thus cannot be understood through our existing mindsets, nor governed by our existing organizing system. This is why disruption comes from the edge. The greater the expertise of the current system, the more there is to unlearn. The advantage of incumbency will become the baggage of incumbency.\\n\\nOnly by relinquishing our reductionist mindsets and embracing a lens built on complexity and holism can we hope to\\xa0identify the root cause of our problems and seize the extraordinary opportunities emerging allowing us to avoid catastrophic risks. Our hope is that this work will help reframe debates across society and help us\\xa0recognize the possibilities of a new system.\\n\\nIf we can learn to see the world through a broader, clearer lens, we can properly diagnose our problems so that we can prescribe the right medicine, and avoid making decisions that waste valuable resources on misguided interventions.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585c3439be65942f022bbf9b/t/6107fd0ed121a02875c1a99f/1627913876225/Rethinking+Implications.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585c3439be65942f022bbf9b/t/6107fd0ed121a02875c1a99f/1627913876225/Rethinking+Implications.pdf)',\n",

The eco-anxious will find much comfort and hope in this post with insights from Matt Ridley\\'s *Against Environmental Pessimism.* 👇👇👇\\n\\n**2. Starving world?** Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford biologist, wrote in 1968: \"in the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death.\" Instead, famine deaths have fallen from millions to thousands. This happened despite the world\\'s population more than doubling since then.\\n\\n**3. Prosperity is good for the environment.** Ridley writes, \"Forests are still being cut down in poor countries, but they are expanding in rich ones.\" Countries start reforesting once they hit $5k per capita income. Forest cover in China has increased from 16% to 22% since 1990.\\n\\n**4.** Contrary to conventional wisdom, the globe is greening. The increasing Co2 levels in the atmosphere have created a \"carbon river\" that feeds forest regeneration. Since 1990, a green cover \"twice the size of the United States\" has been added to the planet.\\n\\n**5. The oceans recover.** There were less than 5,000 humpback whales in 1960s - today \"there are at least\\xa080,000.\" Oil spills have gone down by 80% since the 1980s due to \"double-hulled tankers and GPS navigation.\" King penguins &amp; fur seals, once rare, now number in millions.\\n\\n**6. Worried about overfishing?** Close to 50% of \"our seafood now comes from farmed fish and shrimp.\" Wild fish are still caught to feed farmed animals, but edible lab food might soon render this practice obsolete.\\n\\n**7. Invasive species.** Not everything is trending in the right direction. Invasive species, for instance, continue to drive native island species to extinction. The brown tree snake alone has \"caused the extinction of 12 bird species on Guam.\"\\n\\n**8.** Nevertheless, progress is \"not only possible, but likely.\" New Zealand for example, has successfully removed invasive species from nearby islands through poisoned rat bait. Now they plan to remove all invasive \"mammalian predators by 2050\" from the mainland.\\n\\n**9.** Ridley says some shy away from reporting positive news about the environment as they believe it will lull people into complacency. But Ridley says success and positive stories will instead encourage us to take on bigger challenges.\\n\\n**10. Bottom line.** Many experts have predicted doom in the past - and been proven wrong. Matt Ridley argues that we should instead be optimistic about the environment\\'s future, and presents compelling evidence to back his case.\\n\\nCurious to hear your thoughts!\\n\\nIf you enjoyed reading this, check out my [full notes](https://memod.com/MrClimate/8-reasons-you-shouldn-t-worry-about-the-environmen-3317) from Ridley\\'s essay.',\n",

It was a stark, detailed and credible warning of the choices ahead of us - over the next few years in particular - and the extremes of heat/wet/dry we’ll experience if we don’t act with intention and care as temperatures increase from the current 1C rise we're experiencing already.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfgd337nmxo71.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d257f060a09da874c45f259866c6a700a9496c8f\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46vi217tmxo71.png?width=1526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d2e2d830ec5dd9fed1d0a6b5e2adad74388353f\\n\\nIt also presents scenarios for us to get back to a sustainable and stabilized climate by reducing and removing CO2e emissions from now onwards. These scenarios are still possible, and cause for hope that we can limit and reverse some of the damage we’re already feeling the start of now.\\n\\nIf we want to stay somewhere between 1.5 - 2 degrees celsius increase we don’t have much additional CO2 we can add to the atmosphere. Roughly about 300–550 gigatonnes of carbon budget left globally to be in with a good shot of limiting heating (at present we emit about 50 gigatonnes a year).\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1nxvr3bylxo71.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e5651b824485c7a05275f122ee7597f4d6e9e6a\\n\\nIn these lower emissions scenarios (SSP1–1.9 and SSP1–2.6 in the report) which keep us around 2 degrees or less there isn’t a sustainable rate of emissions post net-zero, other than those that we also remove through nature-based and technology based carbon removal initiatives. Also, it also assumes we start reducing annual emissions significantly from now onwards.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wid2vr3mxo71.png?width=1532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e65a10aadd958c541c4b6d696bfd9a8638da0b2\\n\\nAt present international pledges and commitments don't put us on a trajectory for either lower temperature increases scenario, though there's hope that we can get closer. We're presently on track to be somewhere between the intermediate (with a best estimate of a 2.7 degree increase) and high (best estimate about 3.6 degree increase) scenarios.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibvrcg81nxo71.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=084647c51f02d6a4118a4de0cbf85b410d388d23\\n\\nFortunately the science says we're no longer on the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) track with a best estimate of 4.4 degree increase, which shows we can make progress, albeit not as fast as would be ideal so far.\\n\\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how we got here, the hidden emissions in our daily lives and the hopeful path forward, we made a\\xa0[14-day email course](https://www.zopeful.com/course/intro-to-climate) about it all. :)\\n\\nThe full [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) is here (the 40 page summary is more than enough to get the gist!)\",\n",

       " {'selftext': \"Many people think planting trees is a good idea, but with a bit of math you easily see that this is pointless. There is in total 3208 billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere, and of this 1074 billion tons are from us humans. So how many trees would it take to do that?\\n\\nThe mass of a larger tree is around 9t, 40% of which, or 3.6T is dry mass which for simplicity we assume are carbohydrates with the simplified chemical formular C(H2O). So how much carbohydrates would have to grow to remove the 1074 billion tons of CO2? And how many trees would that be? To know that, we have to multiply the mass of CO2 with the molar mass of C(H2O) = 30g divided by the molar mass of CO2 =44g, then divide that by the dry mass of a tree.\\n\\n1074 billion tons \\\\* (30g/44g) = 732 billion tons of carbohydrates\\n\\n732 billion tons / 3.6T = 203 billion trees!\\n\\nYou would need 10 thousand team trees to do that. Also each tree needs around 6m (50ft) of space around it, so one tree would need (6m)² \\\\* π = 113m² (1214ft²) of land, this times 203 billion trees would be a 23 million km² (8.9 million mi²) forest we would have to plant, which is 4 times the size of the amazon rainforest. I don't think we even have that much land to spare where trees could grow. I think came up with something that might actually be realistic and would love to know what you guys think.\\n\\n**An alternative solution**\\n\\nTrees grow rather slowly, an average hardwood tree takes about 15 to 20 years to reach 9 tons, so why not plant something that grows faster, like bamboo? The fastest growing plant is a chinese bamboo tree that grows up to one meter or 3 foot a day and grows to 25 to 30m in a months. With a diameter of 25cm (10 inches) one meter weights 30Kg (66lbs), with a water content of around 50% that's 15kg (33lbs) of dry mass (carbohydrates), so a mature tree would have around 0.8 tons (1800lbs) of dry mass, and it needs only about 1.7m² of land. So if we would wanna remove all 1074 billion tons of CO2 at once, how many bamboo trees and how much land would we need? So we already know we would need to grow 732 billion tons of carbohydrates to remove all that CO2.\\n\\n732 billion tons / 0.8 tons = 915 billion bamboo trees\\n\\n915 billion \\\\* 1.7m² = 1556 billion m² = 1.556 million km² \\n\\nSo in theory with bamboo we would only need around 1.6 million km² (600 thousand mi²) which is almost 14 times less then with trees as well as 20 times as fast. I'll admit, this would be under ideal conditions, so in practice it would most likely take more land, probably several times as much. But even if we need 5 or even 10 times as much it would still be far superior to planting trees.\\n\\nWe probably couldn't plant them all at once, it would be more practical to plant bamboo forests every year and cut them down next year to plant new bamboo trees in the same area. We might also use several fast growing bamboo species that can grow in different climates, that way we can spread it out into several forests around the world. The other species won't grow a meter per day, but probably still fast enough.\\n\\nOf course all this would result in 732 billion tons or 915 billion m³ (32 trillion ft³) of wood, that's 915 km³ (220 mi³) or a cube with a side length of 9.7km (6 miles). That's way more then the entire world could ever use, and we'd have to find ways to permanently store that somewhere. We could roast it to charcoal and press it to get 293 billion tons of coal which would reduce the volume to one sixth, which might be challenging to do at this scale.\\n\\nAnyway, if you have any criticisms I'd love to know. I know this solution sounds crazy, but I think at this point we have to seriously consider solutions like that, I see no way we could make it otherwise at this point. I think we have to spread the idea of planting bamboo instead of trees, since it could actually be a realistic solution and not just virtue signaling.\",\n",

While maintaining a decent quality of life, for humans ...\\n\\nIn order to accomplish this...we would require **100 cities with 100 million people each**, with a population density between Manhattan and Tokyo -  vertical factory farming, hydroponic farming, aeroponic farming, and fish farming, desalination, free efficient public transportation, powered by renewable energy and nuclear…connected by hyperloops or bullet trains.\\n\\nThis will take time and stages....So, the first two cities to be built would be connecting Sudan or Somalia, to Mauritania or Western Sahara, via hyperloop. This is mostly for freight not people. Allowing shipping companies a cheaper alterative to the suez canal or horn of africa, while reducing the pollution. The hyperloop would require solar on top, and trees to be planted on either side in order to reduce damage from sand, this also creates carbon sink. \\n\\nThose first two cities and next 30-40 Cities would allow us to raise, 3-4 billion people out of extreme poverty while reducing their overall carbon, pollution, and impact on environment. building these cities it allows us to better organize, maintain, and redevelop key infrastructure for recycling, sewage treatment, and trash.\\n\\nIn order to build these in any manageable time, and allow for reasonable accommodations, we would need to factory prebuilt mix use skyscrapers; retail/commercial on ground floors, office mid, residential top. Each building would be one acre footprint and require space for 1,0000 people. So the city would be 100,000 buildings on a 100,000 acres without industrial, which would be about 160 sq miles per city. So 100 cities at 160 sq miles = 16,000 sq miles out of  57,308,738 square miles of earth...which is .02%  .... So if we are allowing up to 1% of the earth to be used, this allows .98% of the earth or \\\\~557,087 sq miles to be used for; vertical factory farming, hydroponic farming, aeroponic farming, fish farming, desalination, renewable energy sources,  nuclear energy, and other industries. \\n\\nHow much do you think it would cost? \\n\\n20 billion a year for the next 40 years? \\n\\nor how about 100 billion per year for 30 years?\\n\\nyou know what your right!  250 billion per year for 40 years....absurd right?\\n\\nAmerican's give \\\\~$456 Billion per year to 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 organizations per year...\\n\\nIf you actually read this whole thing, I appreciate it...I am going to go put on my tin foil hat, and wait for the replies telling me I am crazy for writing this wall of text...just needed to write out some of this idea I have rattling around in my head, I have a bit more, but that seems good enough for now...Have a good day!\",\n",

Also is it futile to even try to capture carbon at ground level since the real issue is in the upper atmosphere or will it still help?   \\n\\nWhatever the system is, I would want to end up with a non hazardous product that is a solid or liquid at room temp so I can burry it or something. \\n\\nIt will be a drop in the bucket but way I see it, if I can at least make my carbon foot print negative then I'm doing my part I guess.

The state also became stricter about development in flood plains. The area in Waterbury on the West Bank of the Naugatuck River that had been washed away was never rebuilt, instead it was turned into the Route 8 Expressway. \\n\\nLast month, Germany was also slammed with horrible flooding. But unlike the Nutmeg State\\'s cool and composed response, the official word from the Germans is to panic, saying the floods were the work of ~~god\\'s wrath~~ climate change and that the only way to prevent future disasters is to ~~repent sins~~ cut carbon emissions. \\n\\nOf course, if politicians didn\\'t divert attention to climate change, I\\'m sure the public would pay much more attention to other more important factors, like lax restrictions on developing over wetlands. And that alone can make a big difference\\n\\nIn 1910, Massachusetts had problems with flooding on the Charles River, so they built a dam at its mouth between Boston and Cambridge. It kept flooding in check and as an added bonus, it created a freshwater reservoir.\\n\\nBut by 1970, the Commonwealth noticed that floods had increased. The global temperature had only increased by .4 degrees celsius in those 60 years, so that couldn\\'t be the reason. Instead what had happened was urban sprawl had led to a dramatic increase in impermeable surfaces and all that water running off of rooftops and parking lots was overwhelming the Charles. So, they had to build another, bigger dam downstream, which was finished in 1978.\\n\\nSo what are real solutions to flooding? It is mainly to remove the asphalt and cement barriers we\\'ve erected between rain and soil. Houston recently started offering tax credits to developers that incorporate smart stormwater management systems and New Orleans has gone further, requiring parking lanes and sidewalks on all new road projects to incorporate pervious pavement. \\n\\nOther places have gotten even more creative. Orange County, Florida, home of Orlando, recently passed a law giving legal rights to its waterways. It\\'s now being used in a lawsuit against a developer who is trying to fill in wetlands and streams. And activists are pushing to add similar protections to the state constitution. \\n\\nI imagine that in the run up to the vote, developers will be running ads making excuses that floods are not caused by their paving over nature, but by... climate change.',\n",

It was actually a pleasant experience and has me interested in purchasing a hybrid for my next vehicle if not a total electric car. \\n\\nHaving said that I'm a little skeptical of climate change. By skeptical I don't mean that I do not believe it is happening I just wonder about the percentage of contribution by mankind and how big of an effect it will have combating it. Seems to me no matter what we do we are on the eventual path of climate change anyway. That doesn't mean I feel we should throw our hands up in the air and forget any attempt to correct it. However, as a conservative, I believe we need more climate change advocates that lead by example and not just by verbal language. \\n\\nFor instance the people in Hollywood who I think are a bunch of clowns own huge mansions private jets private yachts- they preach to people about sacrifice and saving the planet yet they live luxurious energy wasting lifestyles that most of us will never experience. In addition, to make the movies that they sell to us must waste the equivalent of providing energy for a whole town for months on end. Their films require transportation for all film members actors supporting cast supporting staff, living quarters, post-production processes that involve high intense computer work, and much more. \\n\\nNext the politicians - is it really necessary to have these meetings halfway around the world Many of them using private transportation to get there , staying in lavish hotels, and all the other wasteful energy consumption they do to have these meetings. It's not necessary. Having a zoom meeting would be just as effective. They're preaching to us about the changes we need to make without really making any of the sacrifices themselves. \\n\\nWe need a reasonable approach without the extremists from both sides. The idea that we would be totally electric in a decade Is not realistic.  Air transportation alone will need to stay with fossil fuels for quite some time. I know I wouldn't feel comfortable in an electric jet until it's had quite a long time of research , development and trials. \\n\\nPlenty of conservatives I know are behind the idea of addressing climate change and/or pollution. To attract even more I think we need to get away from the overused and redundant verbiage that constantly comes from the media- existential threat being the number one offense. Stop it already. It's an important issue that needs to be addressed and as I mentioned before reasonable solutions should be enforced. The extremist calling for us to do away with eating natural meat and switching over to lab grown meat, That's just insane to me and you're going to lose a lot of people with just that solution alone. Stay focused on electric vehicles which we have been. Work on carbon capture so we can have something to help while we are implementing this changeover and allow time for more solutions to come to the table.  We can attain a smoother, less interruptive transition with this method. \\n\\nAs for me, I have changed all my windows in my house to double pane, led lighting, fuel efficient car, efficient washer and dryer, I keep my AC at 80 while I'm not home. I used to collect the shower water with a bucket while it was heating up and use that water to flush the toilet however my wife got sick of the bucket being in the in the shower..

This one — and I don’t recommend you read this essay if you’re at all feeling anxious or depressed — goes like this.\\n\\nHere’s the way that I think about the future — don’t worry, this isn’t the thought itself, just the context. The 30s are going to be the decade of global warming (aka “climate change”) turning catastrophic. Megafire, megaflood, megatyphoon, “heat domes” — all these will replace the gentle seasons as we once thought of them. The 40s, the decade when mass extinction — already accelerating — begins to upend the basic systems of our civilization. And the 50s will be the decade of the Final Goodbye — when our civilisation’s systems simply crash and come to a halt, food, air, water, medicine, all in short supply, because we cannot produce them anymore, having killed the living planet.\\n\\nThat much you should already be able to feel. In the searing temperatures of the twin heat domes still covering much of the planet. In the way that much of the planet can’t get vaccines for a new plague. Or the way that a new plague is simply being left to breed new variants, each more infectious and deadly than the last.\\n\\nWhat I’ve described to you is a set of megatrends. But beneath them runs another one, perhaps the grimmest of all.\\n\\nThe age of the Great Dying has begun.\\n\\nI know that sounds grandiose, melodramatic, and faintly ridiculous. I don’t want it to be true, and I don’t write it for hyperbole’s sake. Let me simply present you with some facts that will explain what I mean — and leave you, probably, as chilled as I am.\\n\\nA grim threshold was recently crossed. 4 million people around the world are now dead of Covid. How many people is that? More than in all the wars in the last half century or so. It’s nearly the population of a country like Denmark. It’s a staggering number. And it’s only just the beginning. Let me come back to it, though. For now, let’s call it 5 million, because even epidemiologists will agree it’s certainly a dramatic underestimate.\\n\\nAnother such line was crossed, too. Extreme temperatures now kill more than 5 million people a year. That number, too, is going to rise dramatically, because we’re only at the very beginning of a trend of runaway warming.\\n\\nPut those together, and you already have 10 million people dead. In the last year or so. From a new pandemic, and from a warming planet. Ten million people.\\n\\nHow many is that? It’s more than the populations of Denmark and New Zealand. More than the population of New York City or London.\\n\\nLet me say it again. Already — in this past year or so — ten million people are dead. Of things that did not exist a few years ago. A new pandemic, and a warming planet. More people are already dead from the new catastrophes we’ve made than make up entire countries.\\n\\nMaybe now you see a little bit what I mean by this especially grim term “the Age of the Great Dying.” Still think it’s hyperbole, exaggeration, overstatement? (Maybe you do, if you’re a certain kind of privileged white American. So try imagining being the families of one of those ten million people who are already dead.)\\n\\nTen million dead and counting. I want you to reflect on that and think about it carefully. Did you know? Why didn’t you? What does it mean? Should you be indifferent to it? Is your ignorance manufactured for the benefit of elites, perhaps?\\n\\nTen million dead in one year from Covid and global warming. That’s how staggeringly fast what I’ve called “the Age of the Great Dying” is happening.\\n\\nThe crucial questions are: how many more will there be, and how fast?\\n\\nThe answers are not good. Covid is going endemic. Nobody cares about vaccinating the world, except a handful of doctors and scientists. Rich Westerners couldn't care less, so their governments don’t care, so Covid’s exploding worldwide. You know the story: new variants emerge, that are vaccine resistant, and everybody’s at risk from them, even in the rich West. Covid is becoming a new plague — it’s not just a pandemic anymore, a thing that goes away after a couple of years.\\n\\nAll that’s confirmed by the fact that the trend is accelerating. See that chart above? This last year or two’s 4 million deaths are just a beginning. The curve is bending upwards. That’s an ominous, horrific line to see. It hasn’t even hit an inflection point yet. The exponent is still growing. That means, in hard terms, we should expect to see double that number every year or two. 8 million? 16 million? 32 million? All these are very, very real possibilities.\\n\\nBut Covid’s not the only game of death in town.\\n\\nWarming’s already killed five million people this year, roughly. We hear about the small catastrophes — a few hundred dead in Canada, another few in California, and so on. Of course those deaths are terrible and tragic and they matter. But the number of excess deaths ascribe to extreme temperatures far, far exceeds those. People simply dropping dead of heatstrokes, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary issues, asthma attacks, and so on. That’s how you get five million dead of extreme heat already.\\n\\nYou can see that this summer is severely, severely abnormal. It’s shattered even the worst predictions. The twin heat domes lingering over the planet made parts of Canada as hot as the hottest place on earth, Jacobabad, Pakistan. The heat is off the charts almost everywhere on the planet. Take a look, for example, at this picture of planet earth.\\n\\nWarming has only just begun. We’re already at five million dead a year. The temperature has barely even risen one full degree yet. We’re on course to hit four degrees or more. And every degree the temperature rises — the global mean — deaths will occur probably at exponentially greater rates. Barely hitting one degree puts us at five million deaths per year. Two? Probably easily an order of magnitude greater than that — fifty. Three? Five hundred. Four? Let’s not even go there.\\n\\nIf you don’t get why, just imagine how badly our civilisation is going to break. Just one degree of warming and Canada’s on fire. Now imagine two. Still think that power grid is going to supply the air conditioning that keeps you comfortable? Who’s going to be able to live in places like Las Vegas and California — or India, Pakistan, Iran, and, well, much of the planet? At three, the planet’s tropics have become Fire Belts, and societies simply stop working, as climate refugees flee by the millions, and even in survivable cities, simply going outside is taking your life into your own hands. And I haven’t even mentioned wet bulb temperature yet, which means: it’s impossible for you to survive, period.\\n\\nPut just those two catastrophes together — global warming and Covid — and you have exponentially rising death rates over the foreseeable future. We hit ten million dead a year — snap — just like that, faster than you probably believed could happen. But that number is easily going to rise far, far higher — twenty, fifty, a hundred — faster than you can believe, too.\\n\\nThe human mind does not do well with exponential growth, and it doesn’t do well with death. That’s why most of us are in a desperately feigned indifference. Addicted to our dumb selfies and reality TV and violence and porn and consumerism harder than ever. We are trying, rather pathetically, to deny what’s right in front of our eyes.\\n\\nThe staggering toll of the catastrophes we face is not set in some distant, remote future. It is beginning to happen right here, right now.\\n\\nThe Age of the Great Dying has begun.\\n\\nIt’s not a joke, and it’s not a drill. If we were a saner kind of being than the vicious, greedy, domineering, hierarchically submissive primates we are — we might even care more. Enough to stop it. As it is, though, you can see another trend, hidden beneath the mass graves of the dead of this new Dark Age.\\n\\nAn even greater indifference.\",\n",

While the exact extent of the economic damage cannot be determined, there is strong evidence that the damage may be too severe. The challenge facing policymakers is In determining the amount of spending on measures to reduce gas (Co2 emission ) greenhouse. And to do that, they have to be able to compare Contingent options costs, including **renewable energy** sources and electric cars.\\n\\nThis challenge has become more pressing in the world of politics, with climate scientists stressing that emissions reductions must be rapid and deep, with a view to bringing net emissions to zero by 2050\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# Some activities that appear costly in the short term may actually prove to be costly approaches in the long term The innovation stimulus hypothesis\\n\\n## The cost of technology in the short term\\n\\nTo calculate the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the short term, economists estimate the upfront cost and divide it by the amount of carbon dioxide sequestered (tonnes or equivalent). For example, suppose the government spends $20 million to encourage the development of wind farms to generate electricity and reduce million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, so the cost of reducing emissions will be $20 per ton. This method is a useful way to compare the cost of different ways to reduce emissions.\\n\\n&gt;**A significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions requires the necessary cost accounting So in the long run.Kenneth Gillingham**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5w8wri7bda71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cafa34fd55d13c47ca76103c71c68bdd1c33b54c\\n\\n# Cost comparison\\n\\n[Renewable energy](https://dailypower.org/renewable-energy-and-non-renewable-energy/) technologies are among the least expensive technologies ever compared to the technologies currently used in the generation of electricity from coal  (In dollars per ton of carbon dioxide, based on 2018 dollar value.\\n\\nMost surprisingly, renewable energy technologies are the least expensive of all. (This finding can be applied outside the United States since most of these technologies for renewable energy are traded in global markets.) In fact, the cost of using wind or solar energy may be lower than forecasts if implicit or explicit subsidies are taken into account.\\n\\nHowever, these estimates do not account for interruptions in renewable energy generation—the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow all the time and in cases where large amounts of energy are not used, storage technologies should be used as a complement to renewable energy, such as hydroelectric storage, batteries, or other forms of power generation that can quickly fill the gap when wind or solar power fades.\\n\\nTechnological change and innovation are key factors in the effort of longer-term efforts to reduce climate change through Creating alternatives to fossil fuels.\\n\\n## [Can I contribute to help to reduce co2 emission and how?](https://dailypower.org/co2-emission-reduced-to-0-by-2050/)\\n\\nSource: [https://dailypower.org/co2-emission-reduced-to-0-by-2050/](https://dailypower.org/co2-emission-reduced-to-0-by-2050/)\",\n",

At least six species of land birds were known to live on the island. Barbara A. West wrote, \"Sometime before the arrival of Europeans on Easter Island, the Rapanui experienced a tremendous upheaval in their social system brought about by a change in their island\\'s ecology... By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island\\'s population had dropped to 2,000–3,000 from a high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier.\"*  \\n\\n\\n*By that time, 21 species of trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some combination of over-harvesting, over-hunting, rat predation, and climate change. The island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than 3\\xa0m (9.8\\xa0ft). Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities.

Beverly Haun wrote, \"The concept of mana (power) invested in hereditary leaders was recast into the person of the birdman, apparently beginning circa 1540, and coinciding with the final vestiges of the moai period.\" This cult maintained that, although the ancestors still provided for their descendants, the medium through which the living could contact the dead was no longer statues but human beings chosen through a* ***competition.***  \\n\\n\\ncompetition here results in strength and fighting tournaments.\\n\\nBasically, once humans exhausted the island\\'s natural resources, population dropped 80% in a century, violence erupted and the survival of the fittest kicked in and violent leaders took hold of power.  \\nAnd the fact that they were still cutting down the large remaining trees to use as rollers for their stone statues... Could there be a better metaphor for our obsession with status quo?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI think this holds a lot of the keys to the future.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nClimate change works on a delayed exponential model: due to climate inertia, there is a lag between emissions and temperature increase.

Little did they know that mathematically, the slaughter was already a done deal. If people can\\'t see it happening by taking a look out of their window, they refuse to believe it.

My name is Lucas, I live in a region in Brazil that, according to NOAA, has warmed a little more than 3.5°C on average since 1960 until 2020.\\nIt\\'s funny how here nobody denies global warming, the only deniers I ever met were online and once a professor here obviously being paid to miseducate scholars (shock: back in 2019!) but that\\'s because the whole government policy in Brazil right now is of denial and anti-environmentalism. Imagine our president to be Trump on steroids and without a leash.\\nWell, anyways, one of the reasons I usually sob about, is how in my early 20s me and my friends could already tell there\\'s been a significant warming from what we remember in our lives already. But growing up here all I heard from adults was how much hotter and drier everything was and the elderly had even more stories that today sounds like fairy tale.\\nFrom my childhood until today (I\\'m 26), the climate in the city I live in, went from being classified as highland tropical (Cwb) and is now tropical (Aw).\\nThe climate here is a monsoon-like type of climate: during summer, the Amazon humidity makes an U-Turn by the Andes slopes and towards South/Southeastern Brazil, with one the peaks of rainfall being where I live: 290mm (11.4in) November, 360mm (14in) December, 320mm (12.6in) January, with a smooth transition to dry season, peaking in August (also winter/cool season). Summers were mildly warm from the extra humidity combined with the elevation of 850m on average, where I live it\\'s more around 930m and the higher neighborhoods here reach 1200m. Winters were cool and dry but varying from year to year specially due to El Niño/neutrality/La Niña (pacific water temperatures) strong influence on this region\\'s climate patterns.\\nWell it was a sort of inversed Mediterranean climate, with rainy summer and dry winter, the rainy summer making it never too hot and mild the whole year, a region known for its mildness although locals always felt hot in summer and cold in winter. It even frosted often times here past century, the last time being 1985 downtown at 3.5°C (idk why but in Brazil it can and will frost at anything below 4°C!!!). Today the lowest we get in the same region, which also grew in size and became a bigger heat island, is around 12°C.\\nPhenomena like fog and very cold mornings (around 5°C) completely vanished from my childhood and teens until today. The average air humidity which was rarely below 40% during dry season today is below 30% almost everyday and reaches extremely low values of around 12%. Then it comes October, the worst month of the year.\\nUntil I was a teen, October was a smooth transition from dry to rainy weather: the slight and natural increase in humidity from the warming up atmosphere made it easier for cool humid air to reach us from Antarctica (during winter it\\'s usually cool dry air) bringing the lowest highs of the year, around 14°C and 15°C and rainy afternoons a few times a month but also hot convection summer showers around 30°C. This was a region known for not surpassing the 30°C mark too many times a year, even tho the average high in the warmest month was 28°C, we usually stay very close to our averages with less abrupt shifts like in higher lattitudes.  So then\\nToday\\'s October is a HELL ON EARTH. There was a sudden shift 8-9 years ago, around 2012, when October\\'s suddenly became very dry and hot! Kind of like the Pacific west coast\\'s summer is today. The  all time high here kept at 36°C once in 110 years of measurement, last year we were 36°C in September for a week and then again in October for about 10 days. Many Brazilian cities shattered their all time highs by 4 to 6°C and kept repeating those highs for many days in a row. It was insane.\\nIt\\'s been somewhat like that every October since 2012 or so, never again it was mild.\\nWinters used to bring, on the coolest days, sunny afternoons with highs between 15°C and 20°C, lows between 5°C and 10°C, (in my lifetime) but now those are not even the coldest days in the year. Oh yeah, from a place used not to getting above 30°C above a lot, our \"monsoon\" became weaker which meant more sunny days during summer and now being above 30°C everyday in summer is the rule.\\nBrace yourselves! What I observed from this insanity in climate change, specially warming and drying here, shows me that there was a tipping point: when new scandalous weather patterns suddenly appeared -after showing slow signs during the past decades- and came to stay. Here we are just adapting to feeling hot most of the year, it\\'s quite an abrupt feeling for those who were once spoiled by very mild weather, older houses here even have chymneys and everything was built to let more sun indoors, now everyone hates the sun we want to hide in the shade.\\nThank you for reading.',\n",

Just the last 200 years CO2 levels have increased nearly 50%, and designing buildings around elevated CO2 levels in enclosed areas is already an engineering challenge. High temperatures outside vs high CO2 inside.\\n\\nGoogle around for some articles on this.

But cognitive skills did *not* seem to worsen as CO₂ climbed past that mark   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; In 2016, researchers at Harvard and Syracuse University [found that human cognitive function declined](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/27662232/4892924.pdf?sequence=1)  by about 15 percent when indoor CO₂ reached 945 parts per million, and  crashed by 50 percent when indoor CO₂ reached 1,400 parts per million. \\n\\nFor reference, sleeping in a closed room with no ventilation can easily hit or exceed 1000 ppm, and offices and schools can readily exceed that. The problem is rising CO2 levels increasing the baseline that's multiplied indoors.\\n\\n&gt;  some of the issue’s leading scientists [reviewed all 10 studies on the topic since 2012](https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/do-indoor-co2-levels-directly-affect).  On moderate tests of cognition, they found, the evidence was very  ambiguous: Sometimes higher CO₂ seemed to decrease ability, sometimes it  didn’t at all. But more worryingly, they noted “substantial, but still  inconsistent, evidence” that human performance can decline on especially  challenging problems at moderate concentrations.    \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; “The mechanisms underlying the reductions in performance are unknown,” they added.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;In  other words: There’s evidence that carbon-dioxide levels may impair  only the most complex and challenging human cognitive tasks. And we  still don’t know why.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;In their September review, the  authors noted that many aspects of the problem remain unexplored. For  instance, does CO₂ make the effects of other brain-impairing pollutants  worse? It’s unclear. No one has looked at the effects of indoor CO₂ on  children, the elderly, or people with health problems. Likewise, studies  have so far exposed people to very high carbon levels for only a few  hours, leaving open the question of what days-long exposure could do.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; Perhaps the most intriguing  omission of the research is also the most ominous. Modern humans, as a  species, are only about 300,000 years old, and the ambient CO₂ that we  encountered for most of our evolutionary life—from the first breath of  infants to the last rattle of a dying elder—was much lower than the  ambient CO₂ today. I asked Gall: Has anyone looked to see if human  cognition *improves* under lower carbon-dioxide levels? If you  tested someone in a room that had only 250 parts per million of carbon  dioxide—a level much closer to that of Earth’s atmosphere three  centuries or three millennia ago—would their performance on tests  improve*?* In other words, is it possible that human cognitive  ability has already declined? Gall said he wasn’t aware of such an  experiment.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;But of course, a  large-scale experiment is under way—it’s just not happening under  clinical conditions. You and I are its subjects, and the CO₂ in the  chamber [rises with every passing year](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/12/carbon-emissions-hit-new-high-2019-here-are-5-takeaways/602950/). Clock your baseline cognition now: In another 20 years, you might miss these clearheaded times.\\n\\nDamned interesting.

Now the similar SE 3 model is released, The reviews say it’s got an iPhone 8 body, small battery, small screen, and how the body is outdated. But here’s why it remains one of the most popular iPhones that many like me still love using. \\n\\nThe iPhone SE is the phone that has everything the 12, and 13 models don’t offer:\\n\\n-Touch ID. This is an underrated selling point. Touch ID works great and many people just don’t want their face involved in opening their phone. \\n\\n-No notch, clean lines. Yeah not everyone is ok with the notch. I actually like the SE big bezels, straight lines and symmetry for watching videos, movies, and generally aesthetics. \\n\\n-Small size, one-hand friendly, light weight. Holding a small phone comfortably in one hand is great. I came from a 4 inch screen, so the 4.7 inch SE screen is plenty for me. And those big phones are heavy and don’t fit easy in the pocket like the SE. \\n\\n-LCD display, not OLED.  This is an underrated factor, and differentiates the SE from the 12 and 13 Mini (along with price). Something like 1 in 5 people are sensitive to OLED screens on all the 12 and 13 models. Some of us use our phones all day. We can’t be getting headaches are nausea from using OLED screens at low brightness. I also prefer the look of the LCD screen, it’s more gentle on the eyes. The other model with LCD display is the iPhone 11, which is a great model if you want a big phone for a good price. \\n\\n-Battery life. This is the biggest criticism of the SE. It’s true you do get less battery life than the iPhone 11, 12, and 13, because of the small size battery.  But it’s plenty for me coming from the original SE with an old battery. The new SE also charges up quickly so I can charge it in the car when I drive. \\n\\n-Low price. It’s $429 for the SE3 64gb but I would recommend the $475 128gb model unlocked. 64gb is not enough these days. \\n\\nThe new SE3 (or SE 2022) has the A15 chip which makes it super fast and efficient. But my SE 2020 should last at least two more years with the A13 chip which is also super fast and efficient. \\n\\nThat’s it.',\n",

I\\'ve installed custom roms, bricked phones, fixed them, root them etc. \\n\\nThe time came this month to upgrade my phone, so I choose the **Iphone 13.** Why? Honestly, because there is not a better alternative on the market in this price point that has everything as good as the iphone: screen, battery life, software support, performance, polish etc. The S22 was the only real alternative but I live in Europe and because of Samsung\\'s stubbornness, we still have the galaxy phones with Exynos, which are clearly inferior to their Snapdragon counterparts...\\n\\nBack to the Iphone. It\\'s been a mixed bag of good things and bad things these few days since I bought it.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\n\\n* The phone is beautiful, good construction, the screen looks good and thankfully I don\\'t mind the notch.\\n* Speakers are amazing, the best I\\'ve had \\'till now on every phone I\\'ve owned.\\n* Face ID has been flawless. I like how you don\\'t have to put your phone parallel to your face to unlock it. You just look at it from the natural position your holding it and it just works. Also, it works in the dark :O . I honestly don\\'t miss the fingerprint reader at all. I even prefer the face ID.\\n* I really like the looks of iOS. It\\'s consistent, the animations are beautiful and it just looks well thought out.\\n* Some apps are considerably better and more beautiful than on android.\\n* The haptic feedback is amazing.\\n\\n**Cons:**\\n\\n* iOS and various third party apps have been surprisingly buggy. For example: when trying to add a widget, I can\\'t scroll throught the list; keyboard feedback sound get very loud sometimes: a graphical bug in Apollo where the search bar outline keeps dissapearing; some assets in my carrier app not loading properly. I know, small things but they exist. After hearing everywhere that iOS and its apps are the best and most polished things in the world, my expectations were at a skyscraper level of high.\\n* The notifications from some apps, like Youtube, do not have sound. I don\\'t know if it\\'s a bug or a \"feature\" but I don\\'t see its purpose.\\n* OS navigation. This has been a headache. The lack of a universal back gesture that works EVERYWHERE has been kind of infuriating. Yes, I know about the \"swipe from left edge to go back\" and that various other gestures like swiping down when viewing pictures to go back. When they work, it\\'s fine, but there are various apps where I still have to reach for the corner or do some other thing to navigate through them.\\n* Some apps, like Facebook for example, are just better thought out on Android.\\n* The lack of a proper Reddit third party app. Apollo is fine, but Boost for Reddit which I used on android was still better for me and did not ask me for aprox. 40 EUR for its full set of features.\\n\\n**Not good, not bad but ok:**\\n\\n* Notifications are fine. Sure, as everyone says, they are somewhat better on Android but I don\\'t mind them. I don\\'t receive a million of them daily and they do their job.\\n* Keyboard is fine. Why no haptic feedback on it though? :(( For such a good haptic motor, it\\'s a waste really to not have it.\\n\\nOne thing though, I almost never take pictures with my phone other than documents and the odd photo of my cat doing weird cat things, so I can\\'t  speak about the cameras. I don\\'t have any other Apple products and I can\\'t speak about the integration and ecosystem either.\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text, but after I remembered how much I searched for these kind of posts of android users switching to iOS to see their experiences, I decided to make one myself. Maybe it will help someone.\\n\\nAlso, if you have suggestions of how can I improve my experience on the iphone, I\\'m happy to hear them. I really want to give this phone a fair shot.

Seriously. There are statistics out there that green bubbles get less dates too. Lol. \\n\\n**Other GOOD reasons that pushed me:**\\n\\n* Customization of homescreen and widgets now possible since iOS 14\\n* SMB network file sharing (acts like a airdrop between my windows PC and iPhone)\\n* Battery life. Apple just handles their software better for it. With Android, I always had to think about what was draining my battery or some rogue app and I have to hunt for. I don't worry about that with iPhone.\\n* My android phones normally lasted 2 years until they started crapping out. I got tired of it and switched over to iPhone because anecdotally I have an iPhone 7 that I use to fly my drone and it STILL works flawlessly\\n\\n**My gripes, and I need solutions please:**\\n\\n* I don't use apple keychain password manager. I use google chrome. But when I make new accounts on apps, there isn't a way to suggest passwords the same way google does. *Is there a better solution to this?*\\n* I hate having to reach to the upper left to go back. One handed use is a bit difficult compared to android\\n* While the fuck are images and videos named in some sort of unreadable code? All I want is to be able to name files with date taken. (like how my galaxy did) And when they are sorted by name on Premeire, it's whacky and out of order. \\n* Google keyboard has a splitsecond lag that pisses me off, do I have to just deal with apple's native keyboard?\\n* Face ID doesnt work when I'm laying down sometimes\\n* Siri sucks. Using google assistant takes an extra step which I don't like.\\n* Specific to my car. I have a 2015 Honda Civic LX which doesn't have carplay, so whenever I use siri to do speech to text, it is as if it's a phone call to the car which is highly unusual... It wasn't a problem on my android. It also deliver's siri's voice as if I was on a phone call with Siri. Confusing and a bit frustrating to use. \\n\\nThanks, and much love.\",\n",

       " {'selftext': 'So as title says, I jumped ship after owning exclusively Androids since glorious Xperia days (circa 2012) I have witnessed Android OS making huge steps in all major fields, but still lacking in certain aspects. My latest phone for a couple of years was a Galaxy S20 (base model) which I was very happy about and was one step from switching to Galaxy S22 Ultra, but I didn\\'t and here we are.  Worth noting that I am using an iPhone and iPad for work since 2018 so I am bit familiar with iOS and knew what to expect. A few notes: \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat I love: \\n\\n* Consistency and fluidity. It\\'s just on another level.\\n* Camera performance, also superior. Anyone with pets or young kids will confirm. A big decisive factor for me.\\n* The \"just works\" which is true (but with some caveats)\\n* Optimization and battery life.\\n* AirTag implementation (mostly applicable to my use-case, but still)\\n* Premium Feeling and build quality. \\n* Car Play is miles ahead of Android Auto (AKA Android BugFest Auto)\\n* It\\'s just the perfect size and shape. Also subjective.\\n* It looks gorgeous (not subjective at all, it just does.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat I will miss: \\n\\n* Simplicity of everyday staff (adding a custom ringtone or alarm sound from a Windows PC is unnecessarily hard)\\n* Drag &amp; Drop files from and to my Windows PC. But it happens very rarely these days so I am willing to live with it.\\n* Seeing the battery usage and screen on time since last full charge.\\n* Widget functionality\\n* Notifications are weird, but it\\'s another thing I was aware of\\n* Finding a contact by partially typing their number in the dialer.\\n* Limited of personalization (still planning to experiment on that field though)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn my case I knew exactly what to expect, and I made the decision knowingly. Camera performance is a big issue for me as I simply want to capture moments that I will not have second chance, and I am not willing to carry a full size DSLR around. I also wanted to change a bit from Android, and possibly come back after 3-4 years. \\n\\nHappy  camper so far, and if you have any suggestions for a case that completely eliminates the camera bump I would be grateful.',\n",

Like many of us I really enjoy looking into leaks and fanboying hard about the new iPhone. I think that is all changing now. \\n\\nI have slowly but surely grown out of the whole “must have newest thing” mindset. At the same time I’ve been getting all of my possessions in order. Getting rid of things I don’t use or need, canceling subscriptions, and generally just simplifying my life. \\n\\nDuring that process I started to question my current mobile set up.

Main reason for switching is that I didn't like the direction android phones were going with their camera processing, that and the apple watch is just so much better than what is available on wear os.\\n\\nLike the switch so far, but I do have 5 complaints.\\n\\n1. Back gesture isn’t as good as on android: This might seem odd as the number one complaint. But I find the back gesture on iphone to be really lacking. On android I feel like it works on everything, and on iphone, especially with third party apps this isn’t the case. Once again, this may seem fairly inconsequential, but on android where success rate was almost 100%, to even have it at 90% on iphone, is a real annoyance.\\n\\n2. Imessages isn't as good as android messages for me: This is one I really wasn’t expecting, I always see people saying imessage is a reason they can’t switch to android. But why? With more people having rcs on android, I don’t see any benefits with imessage over android messages? It’s cool to see that people have their notifications off on imessage, but I haven’t noticed a single other benefit. I do know I lose android for web, don’t ever plan on buying a mac, so it’s annoying I can’t message on a browser. Also losing scheduled messages is a little inconvenient.\\n\\n3. Annoyed no double click to summon camera: A small one, but I find it really annoying that the double click is for apple pay, and not the camera. I have two camera apps on my home screen and it’s still a pain. The double tap on the back doesn’t work that well with me.\\n\\n4. Notification Pull down is a bigger hassale compared to android notification due to apple notification pulling down a new screen.: Find it really annoying that you basically have to pull down all the way and go to a different screen entirely when you want to see your notification. On android you can just do a quick pull down on any app, do what you want with the notification and continue.\\n\\n5. Apple watch vibrates every mile ran: Couldn’t actually think of a proper 5th one, but I do find it annoying that the apple watch will vibrate every mile you run, and there’s no way to turn that off. I personally run on the treadmill, and I cover the screen with a towel so I don’t know how many miles I have left. I can turn of the haptics manually and turn them back on when I’m done, but it’s a pretty big pain.\\n\\nOther then that, no real complaints. Really excited to upgrade to a premium iphone when they get the periscope lens, and don’t see myself switching back to android for many years.\",\n",

Then one day, my brother comes and says that iPhone users only buy iPhones because they want to feel good about themselves while showing off their status. When I argued that it was just a stereotype, and that I\\'ve talked to people and they use it because they love it, he just said, \"there\\'s almost no useful feature that an iPhone delivers and my Redmi Note 10 doesn\\'t. Nobody will accept that they\\'ve bought a phone to show off, so they\\'re just making excuses.\" \\n\\nWhen I asked for proof for his strong claim, he started talking about evolution. \"During ancient times, when humans weren\\'t so civilized, they used to live in groups. Living in groups would better protect them from danger and also help them hunt more efficiently. Of course, there would be confusions and disputes, so these groups always had one intelligent leader who\\'d tell the members of the group what to do. As time went by, these leaders slowly started to allocate more resources to them, like more food than other members. But the other members didn\\'t rebel against this because he was a good leader and helped them hunt really efficiently. But other members of the group would get envious. Envious of the power and privilege of the leader. This is just human nature. They wanted to be like the leader, to look like the leader, to talk like the leader, to eat like the leader, etc. Since then, humanity has come a long way in civilization, but that ape-mindset has never gone. It\\'s human nature to try to be like those who have a higher status than them. Today, people see the celebrities, the elites and rich people use iPhones. So they buy iPhones too, just to feel like they\\'re among the elites and to show off how elite they are.\"\\n\\nI said that his theory just looked at a few aspects of human nature and there can be thousands of theories drawn to explain why people buy iPhones, but they\\'re not equally convincing. He asked me to come up with another theory that explains the people buying iPhones. Of course, I couldn\\'t weave out a big theory like his in a few seconds, so I just commented that his theory wasn\\'t convincing. He then said that I was rejecting science and I\\'m therefore deluded. When I asked for proof that I\\'m deluded, he just said that he\\'s a doctor and has studied psychiatry. If I want to know more about my delusion, I need to do a Psychiatry course. I couldn\\'t help but give up.\\n\\nI know that you can\\'t always justify your purchases with features. There are a lot of people who think that iPhones have less features than Android ones, but still buy it, because they just love it. And comparing specs doesn\\'t always act as a good defense anyway, because most gimmicks that come with premium phones in general aren\\'t something most buyers care about. At least from my experience, most iPhone users buy iPhones not because they have more features or they bring something more useful to the table, but simply because they love it. \\n\\nYou don\\'t always need a reason to like something, but here I go: what\\'s your reason to buy an iPhone? Is my brother right all the way? Or he\\'s just a duffer?\\n\\nHopefully, I\\'m not deluded. But losing my mind already. Thanks!',\n",

       " {'selftext': 'I have owned more Android devices than Apple devices, but have been with Apple since the XR (XR, 11 Pro, 12 Mini and now 13 Pro). It seems every year when a new Android device is released, I get the itch to switch (#bars), LOL. This year it\\'s obviously the S22 Ultra (Note). I have been watching YouTube reviews and seriously considering switching back, but then I remember what pulled me to iPhone and keeps me here:\\n\\n**The updates:** I know Samsung has been doing better, and Google always has timely updates, but the way Apple releases updates, and has timely bug fix updates is unmatched. Knowing that my phone could easily last another 4-5 years with support is comforting.\\n\\n**Tech Support:** After I had my XR for about 7 months, the silent switch on the side of the device would not stay locked in position, so it was wiggling between the two positions, so in my pocket it felt like I was receiving notifications because it would give me a haptic vibration when it slid to the vibrate position (really annoying). I took it into the Apple store and the tech support guy fiddled with it for a few minutes and then said \"this can\\'t be fixed in the store.\" Of course that upset me because I have previously dealt with Samsung and having to mail my device in for repairs, but he quickly eased my worries and said \"I\\'ll go get you a new device from the back.\" I was surprised, because like I said, when I had the Samsung, I had an issue with the charging port and Samsung wanted me to mail it in (understandable due to them not having physical support centers), but also couldn\\'t tell me if it would be covered at their expense, or how long they would keep it. \\n\\n**Family:** If it weren\\'t for most of my family having iPhones, and us all using Apple Music together ($15 a month for 6 devices is a good deal) I might be more likely to want to switch back. iPhones work mostly flawlessly by itself, and how they interact with other iPhones i.e. AirDrop, iMessage, etc. is very convenient. \\n\\n**Accessories:** It\\'s no surprise that everywhere you look there\\'s multiple accessories for iPhone. Of course other phones have accessories as well, but walk into any store and you are more likely to find a much wider selection of accessories for the iPhone over any other device. \\n\\nThese are a few reasons I have stayed with Apple, if you have any to add, please do because I might not have considered it. \\n\\nTL;DR I have stayed with Apple for updates, tech support etc. add your reasons for being loyal, I\\'d like to hear what others enjoy about their experience.',\n",

       " {'selftext': \"The iPhone 12 was the first iPhone I bought. I was waiting for the 13 Pro to come out before I switched, but I was gifted an apple watch before it release so I bought the 12 and upgraded to the iPhone 13 Pro. I was specifically waiting for it because of the 120hz refresh rate screen. I was using a One Plus 8 Pro before that, and before those were Pixels, Samsungs, HTCs, and a Motorola droid.\\n\\nI love using iOS. I have an iPad Pro and a MacBook Pro as well. I love the continuity between devices.\\nHowever coming from Android (and still using one as a secondary phone) there are features that I'd love for iOS to improve upon so I can move over to the platform and leave Android.\\n\\nI know I can email Apple about features, which I've done it the past, but I believe social media provides more visibility for wanted features.\\n\\nMost of these features are things that iOS has but I wish it was better implemented.\\n\\nFeatures I'd like to see improved:\\n* The back gestures\\n  * The implementation of this inconsistent and is not universally available. Sometimes it's available in some screens in apps and in some apps in general. On Android, if I'm in an app, I can swipe across from the edge of my screen to go back a menu or back to a previous page. On iOS this is inconsistent to me. The back gesture is from left to right only and the gesture is not universally available. When it's not available you have to rely on accessing the back button from the top left of your screen. It's a stretch to reach for. This leads me to my next request.\\n* Improved reachability mode.\\n * I think this is a great feature but accessing it is wonky. You have to be careful about how you trigger it or you can unintentionally launch an app from your dock or trigger some event within the app you have on your screen. \\n\\nNew feature I'd like to see:\\n* Multitasking\\n * I believe that this has been one of the most requested features. It's strange that iOS hasn't implemented this but it is available on iPad OS. I believe that Apple wants you to use an iPad for multitasking and an iPhone for regular use. However, in my use case, I don't always have my iPad on me and not having this feature on the phone is limiting.\\n * Here are some examples of where it would be useful for me:\\n  * Setting up bill pay in my bank.\\n   * The other day I was trying to add a biller's account to my bank but I had to keep jumping between my bank and my biller's screen to copy and paste the information. Could this be fixed by the biller having better services on their end so that my bank can autoload their info? Yes, but I find this is more of a luxury that companies have and it isn't common for a few of my billers.\\n * Looking up news about a certain stock while looking at it's chart in my stock trading app.\\n* Signing in via confirmation email\\n* Video on top half and reddit on the bottom.\\n* Sport on top third or half and reading the stats on the bottom.\",\n",

Serisouly, one guy\\'s dumb idea and 15 years later we still have this stupid \"feature\" annoying millions of people at this point.\\n\\nTo sum up the video, Steve Jobs wanted a back button but human interface designer Imran Chaudhri convinced him that the back button would be unreliable and complicated and create a \"trust issue\" for users. The argument was that on Androids the back button might perform different/inconsistent actions: return you to a previous menu, a previous app or the home screen.\\n\\nTheir solution was a software based back button at the top that would always perform the same action of going to the previous menu. Maybe I\\'m an idiot, but how does a software button (which is out of reach and in my opinion much more inconsistent in how, where, and when it shows up) vs a permanent button make a difference here? The software button could also have inconsistent results unless Apple controlled/required third party apps to make sure it did the same thing every time. If they could do that, why couldn\\'t they exercise the same control to make sure said apps would program the permanent back button to always/only return to the previous screen? Or on a hardware level or iOS level, make it return to a previous screen if there was one available, and do nothing otherwise. Or, why isn\\'t the software based button at the bottom of the screen in reach?! Isn\\'t that how Androids do it now? No real buttons but there are touch based buttons at the bottom?\\n\\nI know you can swipe instead of hitting the out of reach back button, but that is inconsistent as well because it\\'s not always an option and you have to reach all the way to the edge of the screen, if you don\\'t swipe from far enough on the edge it won\\'t work. A back button would would still be much more in reach and easier. Plus a quick tap vs a big swipe/drag is quicker and easier and little things like that add up/matter a lot throughout a phone\\'s UI.\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/78pVKJwFLvQ](https://youtu.be/78pVKJwFLvQ)',\n",

Siri also became less responsive and apps started to lag slightly here and there.\\n\\nI put up for it for a while, until a recently moved to Australia where they actually have Apple Stores (unlike NZ), and I decided to pay AU$109 for a battery replacement, and they even threw in a new Belkin screen protector for free for me. 1 hour later and my phone was running like it did on day 0 again - incredible battery life and for some reason, apps noticeable smoother and Siri works like a charm.\\n\\nJust thought I'd share my experience :)\\n\\nTLDR: if your iPhone isn't running too well and battery life is far from what you remember, a relatively cheap non-AppleCare battery replacement with a new screen protector (and maybe even case) could make your phone feel brand new again and save you from splashing the cash on the latest model.\",\n",

Another plus for iphone is that apple pay supports my bank but not samsung pay, but I think there other apps that do. One last thing in iphone you can set different backgrounds for each page with different color palettes which is amazing. For the S22+ I can download apk apps to read manhuas, the one ui 4 looks sick too but I'm not sure if I can set different backgrounds for each page. It has fingerprint sensors and edge lighting(i dont use face id) And FREE BUDS! But it has less battery life than iphone.\\n\\nI don't really care for imessage or facetime, there is Whatsapp for that. I think camera looks the same too i guess. I just want a phone that can whistand a long time and has good battery and esthetics.\\n\\nI'm really indecisive and can't rely on my friends' opinions since they are biased. I hope i can get some advice here. What would you buy and why? What would you advise me? Is the s22+ battery good? Can I get a day or two days of use (i dont do gaming, sometimes im on tiktok a lot)?\\n\\nThanks in advance and look forward to what you think.\",\n",

       " {'selftext': \"Ive had countless arguments with people online regarding the topic of SBMM. The vast majority of people seem to be in favor of removing SBMM or bringing back the less strict SBMM of the past cods. Those few people who have defended SBMM have always come up with simple, thoughtless comments on why SBMM is good, without offering a shred of acknowledgement of players' grievances regarding the issue, and seemingly oblivious to all the solid arguments on why SBMM is bad in theory and in a practical sense. One argument ive seen repeated often by those proponents of the current strict SBMM is that SBMM is a good system, and the proof is that the current or most recent COD titles, MW2019 and Cold War, have some of the best sales performances and revenue of any COD in history. I havent actually looked up the actual sales figures, but my response to those folks has been that you cannot equate correlation as causation, to put it simply, and that the reason for this burst in sales is exceedingly obvious: These current COD titles are some of the most exciting in terms of the hype generated. MW2019 was the first COD to implement a \\\\*massive\\\\* jump in graphics, animations, realism, and really pushed the bar on quality of visuals, gun sounds, and animations. The very notion of realism in shooters and dramatic graphics improvements is an exciting prospect for players. THAT is why titles like MW2019 and Cold War did so good. People who generally loved IW games were exciting by the improvements to modern warfare, and people who traditionally err towards the black ops series and treyarch titles were extremely excited for a new Black ops that utilized this significant graphics jump. Again, THAT is why the sales were so high; people were hyped more than ever and extremely excited. For me, and for so many others, ALL the hype died within a few days when people quickly realized how strict the SBMM is. For MW2019 it was a disaster, especially since camping was encouraged and rewarded more than ever. In Black ops Cold war, the SBMM was so strict to the level of clearly being broken, and yet it was never properly addressed, and players concerns were never properly acknowledged. These games demonstrated to everyone that no matter how good graphics are, and how well and solid a game is, something seemingly so simple as a matchmaking system could ruin the fun of it all. Instead of being fun, these games have been unbelievably stressful, boring, and frustrating. People leave from frustration and ragequits, rather than from satisfaction. Thats been the case for a vast number of players who actually play the game more than an hour a week. Ive told these proponents of SBMM that once the hype surrounding the graphics overhaul dies down, which will take 1-2 games, eventually people will stop buying future COD titles as they'll quickly realize that these games are NOT fun. And now ladies and gentlemen, what ive said and predicted has come. According to the COD devs, Vanguard, which still utilizes this improved engine, and mechanically is still a solid game, has been a flop in terms of sales, and has seen poor sales performance. I dont think vanguard is a bad game, but its clear to me that people have quickly found that CODs matchmaking system is a failed and broken mess, and naturally lost interest in paying $60 in exchange for boredom and misery. The devs are trying to counter this sales drop by doing exactly what they did in MW2019, which is creating a new engine, and ANOTHER jump in graphics, all to generate hype and excitement. I think that people, being generally short-sighted and easily swayed, will end up falling victim to this hype and as such MW2 reboot will have improved sales performance undoubtedly, but just like before if it still has this this broken SBMM system, people will quickly find themselves unhappy, bored, and frustrated, and will stop purchasing future CODs. You can only keep overhauling the graphics so much to revive sales, until people will catch on to the pattern and the strategy will no longer work.\",\n",

Now I’m not a complex guy, I just spam buttons and stuff. But this is one of the few games where a complex play style actually appealed to me. Being able to control which Guardians do what was honestly kind of thrilling, I could have Groot hold down one enemy while I had Drax and Gamora go to town on another while Rocket threw a cluster fark grenade at a small group while I handled a few small guys. It just felt so invigorating. The “Huddle Up” mechanic was an absolutely amazing feature, and the songs toga played after either made me laugh or got me into a slaying ZONE. I liked Avengers gameplay to a certain extent, but this shit was on a whole nother level. I’m intrigued with the fact that they decided to make Star Lord the only playable character but I didn’t really mind that as he was my absolute favorite Guardian. On the topic of the guardians…\\n\\nThe team dynamic is so fucking good. The team actually behaves how a team would, and I loved seeing them grow during the narrative. I, like many others, were most likely introduced to the Guardians via the MCU. But honestly, after playing the game through, I prefer this iteration. Some of the cutscene moments between the team felt authentic, and I enjoyed every little side conversation. Whenever I retrieved an artifact I always went into the room associated with that character to see what it was about.\\n\\nThe story. This game is in my Top 5 favorite video games of all time, cause my god. It started out nice, with us learning about Peter and Ko-Rel and Nikki, and having the fine there set up a nice first act conflict. Selling either Rocket or Groot to Lady Hellbender was a nice mission, and the boss fight with the Dweller-In-Darkness was fun. Side note, I loved how every boss fight was unique in one form or another. No repeats, no reskins, no reused moves, just… Bravo Eidos Montreal. Back on track, I thought that the entire game would revolve around Lady Hellbender hunting us down while evading Nova Corps, but boy was I wrong. The Church of Universal Truth was a pretty compelling antagonistic force, and honestly there were times where I thought that we wouldn’t win against em. Definitely in my top list of video game antagonists. The fact that they were able to spread across the galaxy like a virus and even Nova Prime didn’t know how to stop em was… it was something. There were moments in the story that made me laugh, made me get excited, and moments that came very, very, VERY close to making em cry. The only other games that have done that were Ghost of Tsushima and Marvel’s Spider-Man. I don’t usually cry at video games, but damn this story… Peter’s rejection of the promise and the conversation between Peter and Nikki about Nikki’s promise were some of the most emotional moments I have ever experienced while gaming. Again, Bravo to Eidos Montreal. It deserved the “Best Narrative” award it received, and congrats to It Takes Two but I feel that this should’ve been GOTY for 2021. Then again I haven’t played it so feel free to tell me if I’m wrong as fuck down below.\\n\\nSorry about my essay on this game but holy shit, if you haven’t played it yet I implore you, please try it out.

Making the game more important than taking a call from me. \\n\\nThis is seriously harming our relationship because first and foremost, it is not healthy at all. I think she knows its damaging us, but she also uses it as an escape, and it's a hole she can't get herself out of. So she's lacking the mindset to see what it is doing to us. \\n\\nWe have spoke about it, and I've asked her to temporarily, not permanently, just temporarily delete the game, so she can get herself out of the hole and focus on other things.\\n\\n Unfortunately, she refused. And she said that it felt like I was 'ordering her' which I wasn't, just a suggestion, and that she won't. \\n\\nAt this point, what is it that I can possibly do? Because at this moment, I feel unimportant and worthless compared to a game that has no benefit in her life nor does it do anything for her or her future. \\n\\nI understand we all have downtime, time to ourselves, space. Completely understandable and no problem. But when going 10 hours a day sometimes, or completely blanking me, it almost seems as if she is ready to sacrifice me over keeping her game.\",\n",

Packed with things to do and feel like you exploring a real city. It's not just horizontal exploration but vertical as well. The parkour feels very smooth. \\n\\nThe gun play is amazing. Better than a lot of fps oriented titles that I've played. Also have a variety of loots like in borderlands. If u don't like gun plays, u can be a stealthy assasin, or a a futuristic samurai with katana, or a hacker (kind of like a mage). They all play really differently\\n\\nGraphics on my ps5 is really good for an open world. Maybe not as good as newer games in 2022, but the art style and attention to details really make you just stop and look around sometimes.\\n\\nThe story is decent. Maybe not as good as witcher 3. I think the biggest criticism I have is your choices don't have as much of an impact like in witcher 3. \\n\\nOverall a great game that takes the best out of many different genres and put into one game. I think people give CDPR too much for the messy launch, considering its one of the few game companies out there that don't have micro transactions in their game, listen to customer's feedback and obviously put a lot of effort into their games.\\n\\nI hope CDPR doesn't get discouraged by all the memes and stop producing quality games. \\n\\nThe story is decent.\",\n",

When I came across the motion detection API I realized I would be able to create the same posture tracking experience but in a much less obtrusive format. A lot of people have their AirPods in their ears the entire day, so they won't have to adjust their lifestyle as much. \\n\\nPosture Pal will keep track of your neck tilt and will alert you when a bad posture is detected, even in the background. Here's a video of it in action:\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bak1eXhinTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bak1eXhinTE)\\n\\nAnd you can download it here:\\n\\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/posture-pal-improve-stance/id1590316152](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/posture-pal-improve-stance/id1590316152)\\n\\n🦒 Posture Pals \\n\\nMy little cousins always ask me if I can also make video games as a developer. I wanted to make something fun together with them, which is why I came up with the concept for Posture Pal where there are animated characters that informs you about your posture. The first Posture Pal is Rafi the Giraffe! 🦒 You can interact with Rafi and they will hopefully make the experience a bit more playful for people. \\n\\n🌎 Localization \\n\\nThanks to friends from all over the world, Posture Pal has already been translated into 18 languages, including: English, Dutch, German, Danish, French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese (Simplified &amp; Traditional), Bulgarian, Turkish, Croation, Portuguese, Korean, Hungarian, Polish, Vietnamese, Norwegian and Afrikaans. \\n\\n🤗 Accessibility\\n\\nPosture Pal has been optimized from the start to be as accessible as possible, with full support for Dynamic Text, Reduce Motion and Voice Over.  \\n\\n\\n💰 Pricing\\n\\nPosture Pal is free to download from the App Store. Users can track their posture for up to ten minutes at a time and can adjust the colors in the app until they relaunch the app. There's a one time payment for $2 (or equivalent) that removes the time limit, adds more customization for the posture tracking sensitivity and the theming of the app. \\n\\nThe proceeds of the first week of sales will be send to the families of our friends that have fled Ukraine in the last two weeks. 🇺🇦\\n\\nI'd love to hear any ideas for what I can add to the app to make it more useful. I've got plans for shortcuts support, calibration, more advanced tracking and streaks as well as some minor ux improvements here and there!\\n\\nJordi\",\n",

So keep in mind I don’t know how git or GitHub works (I know it’s a must have skill I’m still working on it) and I usually deploy my websites using netlify. I decided to give GitHub a try, so I make a repository for my project, and then I go to VScode to put all my projects files and what not in the repository. Then when I was doing that I realized I made a mistake so I decide to delete my repo. Then I realized that VScode still thinks that repo exists so I make a new repo with the same name and this time nothing is in the repo, so I try to make a commit, but nothing is actually happening. So I keep trying to make commits, and then somehow l end up overwriting all my projects files. Then I look in VScode  and it says that I have over 10000 commit updates pending, and then I start panicking because I have 10000 files trying to overwrite my project that I think is super cool(it’s a pretty basic website). Then I remembered GitHub said when I deleted my original repo it said I can’t get it back, so I spend the next hour trying to do all types of git commands in the terminal and I get close to restoring my project, but it’s missing the one folder that makes the project actually work. I was actually about to give up but I did some googling and found out that I can actually restore my repo, so I restored it on GitHub and downloaded my projects and opened it in VScode and it had all my original project files back and it still works.

You can get a .com domain for $10/yr with a domain registrar like Namesilo saving you 50% a year.\\n\\nWith Namecheap you can get a .com domain with an introductory rate of $9, however, the renewal rate is $14/yr.\\n\\nNamesilo is cheaper than Namecheap, Namecheap does have a better user interface for managing your domains. Namesilo’s backend looks more archaic.\\n\\n# Web Hosting \\n\\nInstead of buying your domain and web hosting directly from GoDaddy. It’s actually better to buy your domain separately from a domain registrar like Namesilo or Namecheap, then purchase your web hosting from a provider like Siteground or Bluehost.\\n\\n**TL:DR** \\\\- GoDaddy will overcharge you and upsell you services that are unnecessary.',\n",

I got exposed through coding through my boyfriend and brother who are both web developers and I wanted a career working from home and minimal on human interaction and I love solving puzzles and problems, so it seemed like a good choice. I knew this wasn’t going to be my passion, but as long as I’m decent at something and can make a decent living, that’s all I wanted for now. My boyfriend honestly really loves coding and he said going through his bootcamp and he was really liking it, but he also did a lot of learning for years beforehand. I’m not hating it by any means, it’s awesome to build something and have it work, but I wouldn’t say I’m loving it. But I also don’t know what I’m doing. I’m a complete beginner a little more than half way through a bootcamp and it’s a lot to take in and learn. My bf keeps reminding me that I’m not going to learn all of this all of a sudden and I won’t really know what I’m doing until I’m trained for a job, which is comforting, but it’s still intimidating. I also have moderate adhd and learning things takes A LOT of extra work. I know that I never enjoy things until I know what I’m doing, so I hope once I know more how to do this on my own, I can enjoy it more. Like when I was in school and didn’t understand math, it made me so mad and want nothing to do with it, but when I understood math I was doing I found it quite fun. But idk if this is the same or not!\\n\\nDo you think if I’m feeling this now I’m destined to not be good at it and it be wrong for me?? Or is this a normal feeling?

       " {'selftext': 'Super long but I really appreciate the help. \\n\\nHello, I\\'m just trying to improve my management style as I\\'m really at a loss and I know I can do better, but here is my situation : \\n\\nBackground on me : I don\\'t understand how to code whatsoever, but I understand technology pretty well on a Macro level especially with blockchain, and have a great eye for design and user experience. \\n\\nI formally owned a SaaS company, it wasn\\'t huge, roughly 25 employees we were in operation for about 4 years. I employed a decently large tech firm out of India to build out our software. Initially it started out fine, but as time went on I realized essentially in what my perception of things was they were not working or hitting deliverables whatsoever. It eventually devolved into a large fight where they said we owed them money because they had multiple developers working. My perception was I told them to pull developers off the project months ago because I saw they were not working and I was looking to hire a different team. I thought that they had not listened to this instruction (intentionally) to continue billing me. They ended up hijaking the majority of the code and wouldn\\'t turn it over unless we paid them for these additional devs that I thought were not working anyways, but I also told them not to keep on. \\n\\nFast Forward, I\\'m now running a new Blockchain startup and really struggling with the development side. We\\'re still in startup mode, so I\\'m paying for most of it out of pocket. This is not some pie in the sky dream (although it may be perceived this way) but we\\'re in talks with multiple VCs, and have multiple EXTREMELY solid partnerships in place that should add a ton of validity to the project. I offered one developer, who has a very solid resume and experience, and it seems like we get along absolutely perfectly and he is extremely passionate a percentage of the company to do pretty light work, essentially just manage people that I\\'m hiring (on freelance websites) to do the actual work. He vanished at one point for over a week to work on some other (entirely optional, mostly fun) project. \\n\\nI needed to get a landing page designed, and we needed to keep moving, so I just went and hired someone else (on a freelance website) and tried to manage them myself. We agreed on a set amount of deliverables for a set amount of money, we had agreed on everything prior, I had an adobe XD designed exactly the way it should look.  He achieved basically 90% of the design for Desktop, when I asked him how mobile was going (which admittedly I didn\\'t have a separate design for on adobe, I just maybe wrongly assumed that it\\'s 2022 obviously you should make it mobile responsive.) He said \"this is taking too long you need to pay me more.\" so I was pretty shocked. Told him no, cancelled the contract. \\n\\nHired someone else to finish the job who was a referral, she pulled open the code and was like \"This developers code is trash, but I can finish the 10% he couldn\\'t do\" At this point I am pressed for time on the deliverable because investors and other things are waiting for the landing page, she tells me the date she can have it finished by. I give her 1 extra day just to make sure she can get it done, it comes to that day. Virtually nothing is changed visually that I can see, and she said she doesn\\'t know how to do the other 10% this first guy was struggling with. \\n\\nAt this point, my main developer that was going to get a % of the company shows up. I tell him what\\'s happening, and how I\\'m struggling. He tells me not to worry, is incredibly apologetic for leaving and says he will 100% manage everyone and can even do all the hiring etc; sigh of relief. \\n\\nThen he vanishes again. \\n\\nNow I\\'m sitting here, about to hire someone else to finish this landing page and just totally at a loss of what I\\'m doing so wrong. \\n\\nI hear rumors that in Silicon Valley, and in the Tech world in general, that no one is actually working very much. and the previous company I would work with in India years ago would always tell me that \"developers are lazy\" and you have to constantly monitor them. My perception of things also is when I find a developer that is \"really good\" they essentially refuse to do any real coding themselves and insist on only managing. It\\'s also a challenge because this is just a landing page, the next phase of this is probably 3x more difficult. \\n\\nI\\'m just truly at a loss here of how I can do better and need some advice. Some ideas I have : \\n\\n1 : Get someone I trust with my life that has some understanding of what\\'s happening on the team : It has to be someone I trust fully, because someone with \"enough skills\" or someone I get along with, clearly isn\\'t enough. So maybe myself, or pay for some person I just know and trust to do a full development course so they can at least see the code and see if it\\'s being worked on. (longer term solution) \\n\\n2. Hire multiple developers, from entirely different parts of the world and have them work on the same task and compete against each other with whoever completes it first getting a bonus. \\n\\n3. Find someone with enough skill, or maybe an outside consulting firm who\\'s entire job is to manage developers (out of house that I hire, so they arent connected financially). To manage people, unlike these \"all in one developer houses with managers / devs\" \\n\\n4. Figure out where the good talent is outside of freelancer websites so I can hire them. I\\'m willing to pay. \\n\\nI assume I\\'m absolutely ignorant and making dumb mistakes, maybe my management style is off, or maybe there\\'s some technology I can learn, github, assana, something, to track things and see if they\\'re working - I dont know. But I need some advice.',\n",

At various points during that day (think: less than every minute, more than once an hour), the JS in the web page squirts a geolocation lat/long pair up via a quick POST to a sandboxed company server, so Central Dispatch can tell where their employee is at that point. \\n\\nMy question is: **what's the best / easiest / most secure means in Javascript to return some sort of unique device during that quick POST call?** One that can identify which tablet/phone is associated with each breadcrumb trail point? (Unfortunately, the downloaded web page could be 100% identical to another device's that day, so I can't differentiate them via something we happen to have embedded in the downloaded page itself...)\\n\\nRepeating: again, these are generic company-owned devices, there's no privacy issue here that would ordinarily apply to a generic public client device/user - we control everything. Given that, we \\\\*could\\\\* conceivably pre-load some identifying text file on the device that Javascript picks up and sends back as the identifier...but that seems kind of kludgey and last-resort to me.

       " {'selftext': '\\nTL;DR junior dev had a vision of him jumping off a building to end it all because of stress from a relatively small project. Decided to give up on career instead.\\n\\n\\nI gave up on programming after 1 year of getting a developer job. This is a long pure  rant, on how I gave up on myself after I had visions of me trying to self-harm for the first time in my life. \\n\\nI just freshly graduated in 2017. My final university project was a VR game made with unity. The project landed me a job at a company, and I was put to work on an unity app the company was contracted to do. This was a fringe project, nothing near their main projects, and most of it could be done in no more than 3-5 weeks but I spent 6 months on it because…well I had presented myself as a unity dev to my boss, and they had no other unity project, so I was just stuck there in limbo, maintaining and adding small features here and there for the client. Part of me was naive in waiting for one of my boss to come guide me, as I was still very new, but that part of me slowly understood. \\n\\nAfter 6 months, I felt extremely lost, lonely, deserted and felt like I have not learn anything coming to this company. My friend that had entered the company with me had moved on to another project. Before she moved on, she had done a back-office web for one of the company’s main project. Finally knowing that no senior is coming, I took the initiative to become the sole maintainer of this back-office after her to expand my skillsets and show that I am capable of learning and doing webdev. At this point, I have about 4 months of completely self taught frontend development from my previous internship in angularjs. I added features and maintained the back-office aimlessly for 2 months.\\n\\nAfter 2 months of maintaining the back office, I took the initiative again, and this time I was given an important job on the main project. At this point, I was super happy, the project however created so much stress for me that it would become my last. \\n\\nThe task was simple, there is already a main mobile app to this project, which is a chat-story / short story sharing platform. All of it is user generated content, and while the readers were having a great time reading it on their phone, the writers wanted a way to write their stories on their computers. So they tasked me with creating an text-editor on the web. All the apis were already all written, I just had to do the frontend, it sounded challenging but quite manageable.\\n\\nAt this point I had 4 months of front end experience + 2 months of nodejs / react from maintaining the back-office. The website was already up and running using .net core, with all the api already written, and some webpages using HTML engine. I figured the best thing to do is just  learn a bit of .net core, HTML rendering engine and get working on the frontend. \\n\\nI had initially projected to complete the project in 5-6 weeks, but I was deep 12 weeks into it and I was only 70-80% done. I don’t remember the details but I had spent a huge amount of time doing json parsing and trying to match the editor output from the web with the phone. I was completely stressed out, and remembered that one time the CTO came to me asking for my progress to speed things up and we had a small argument as I told him I couldn’t figure out one particular issue I was facing. He was basically asking why are you taking so long with this project. \\n\\nThe pressure keeps piling up as I am super late based on my earlier estimate. Then one day, 12 weeks after I have started, the company brought in 4 web developers and I knew right away one of their first job is to finish this web editor. \\n\\nI was stressed, writing about this is giving me migraine, and I had reached a breaking point. It was the first time I experienced migraines while programming / staring at the screen as I was trying so hard to get things done and learn the project. I was under high stress for more than 10 weeks without realizing, and I didn’t know I was pushing my limit. One day, I wanted to finish the project so bad I pushed myself to think of what is left and try to plan it out before I go to sleep. That night, the feeling of being a failure, the stress and migraine all came crashing and I had a dream of trying to jump of a building so that it would all go away. \\n\\nI knew at that moment that was the end of this journey for me. The next morning, I gave my boss a 2 weeks notice, not having a job lined up, and not telling anyone except my girlfriend.\\n\\n I picked up coding again 1 month after that, writing a website with contentful and gatsby but I couldn’t finish. \\n\\nThen again trying to do react native app… about 1 month after that but not finished. \\n\\nAll in all I have about 4 months a angular, 2 months of node/react, 3 months of vanilla js, 1 months of gatsby, and 2 weeks of react native.\\n\\nTo a total of almost 1 year of frontend development. And I barely remember any of it… and I have absolutely almost zero knowledge of any other stuff about webdev. Looking back, I never got project from start to finish and this is one of the worst things to repeat.\\n\\nAlways finish what you started, but also take care of your stress. Work is not stress. Work can be fun, exciting and full of meaning. Learning is also important. Fundamentals is also very important. A Very expensive lesson.',\n",

I\\'ve since moved off contract work and took a position as a  senior dev, but I\\'ve put this project on the side and only worked on it  for a few hours a week.\\n\\nIn  December, when I brought the bill he couldn\\'t believe it and was  absolutely pissed despite the fact that I was only at like 40% of the  budget. I was super confused, printed out graphs and everything of how  under-budget and ahead of time I was. Shortly after he starts having freakouts and will call me and tell me to pretty much just stop. Mind you, this is a massive project, delegating the ecommerce side to Shopify saved some time, but I had to essentially generate hundreds of thousands of  products based on some insufficient data. I had to build out tons of infrastructure before anything on the client-side was even visible. He previously paid $3,300 for a WordPress site that you couldn\\'t even access on mobile.\\n\\nSo I give him the website, and say that it\\'s pretty much done. All the hard work generating the product data has been taken care of, all that\\'s left is a bit of content. Of course I\\'m putting like 5 hours a week in at this  point, because he was pissed about how much 10 hours a week was costing.  So the website is missing some features and content, but at the same  time I\\'ve only been paid for 55% of the budget. I go meet him and he keeps saying that he can\\'t believe how much is missing and that he kept saying that he wants a \"Cadillac\" of a website. I tell him that that\\'s not really feasible when he told me to work for $10k and suddenly wants it done under $6k. He then leaves the building, I\\'m then left to talk with another higher-up, and the guy just said, more reasonably, \"I mean yeah, a lot of stuff is missing.\" and I said \"Yeah, I had my budget slashed in  half so I don\\'t really know what to do. I can\\'t put out work without  spending time on it and getting paid for it.\" \\n\\nAnd  that\\'s where I\\'m at now. This is the second time the guy has had a  major breakdown in the two months working with him, so I\\'m really  getting tired of this. What exactly should I do?

You only want users to be able to perform any operation on a Task if the user is authorized on that task. What do you do when a requesting user attempts to perform an operation on task that does not exist, or that does exist but for which the user does not have access?\\n\\nDo you distinguish between these two and raise 404 and 403? Do you instead always return one or the other?\\n\\nI've read people say that you should return 404 in order to prevent hackers from learning whether a primary key exists in the database. I think this sounds smart at face value, but upon closer inspection I don't buy it. A hacker cannot cause any harm if he knows a primary key exists unless you have some massive security flaw in your application. And if you have a massive security flaw in your application, it will be exploited whether or not a hacker knows a particular primary key exists in your database.\\n\\nI think it is much easier to debug problems if you return the correct 404 vs 403. If you are always raising a 404 even though the error was due to authorization, it is confusing to debug this error and causes more work to resolve it.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\\n\\n----\\n\\nIf the resource exists in the database but the user doesn't have access, the obvious decision is to raise a 403 Unauthorized, but you could also chose to raise a 404 Resource Not Found.\\n\\nIf the resource doesn't exist at all in the database, the obvious choice is a 404, but you could also chose to raise a 403.\\n\\nTo make it more interesting, it's also possible to query the row with both the primary key (task_id) and the foreign key (user_id) at the same time, such that if you get no result, you don't know if it was due to the row not existing or due to the user not having access. In this case it is ambiguous and you could chose to raise 404 or 403.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor example, say you query by primary key (task_id) alone:\\n\\n    task = Task.get(id=task_id)  \\n    \\n    if task is None:\\n        raise Rest404()  # or raise Rest403()\\n     \\n    if task.user_id != get_requesting_user_id:\\n        raise Rest403()  # or raise Rest404()\\n\\nBut you can also query by primary key (task_id) and foreign key (user_id):\\n\\n    task = Task.get(id=task_id, user_id = get_requesting_user_id())\\n        \\n    if task is None:\\n            raise Rest403()  # or raise Rest404()\",\n",

Then I had to set up a test server so she could see the changes beforehand. Shes a very demanding and controlling person so it wasn't easy. But eventually it was done and a year later she gave up on the business idea.\\n\\nThen last year my mom wanted a website for her small business she wanted to start. I knew better than to repeat history so I told her to just use WordPress. But then she was saying she doesn't know where to start and would I help her set it up. So that's more time. However she has since asked my sister to help (who knows nothing on Web dev) and she finally has a product live but she occasionally asks me for help, such as getting her site more noticed on Google ads.\\n\\nNow, the same aunt wants a brand new site for a new business idea that she started a few years ago but dropped and wants to pick it back up again. She didn't even really ask me, she said I need a website doing and it needs to go live by March something so when am I free to go through it with her?\\n\\nI'm so sick of family wanting me to help them with their websites because I just don't have the time or want to invest in the time. I also don't feel like I can charge for it. My own mother has given me more than I could ever ask and my aunt is letting me live in her house rent free temporarily while I sort some personal things out.\\n\\nIs there a way to say no, or should I just be so unreliable that they stop asking?\",\n",

       " {'selftext': 'Okay, so I\\'ve been seeing a lot of confusion about Android update terminology when it comes to QPRs, 12L versus 12, etc. Let me try to clear some things up with this post.  \\n\\nFirst of all, there\\'s the initial release of an Android OS version in the second half of the year. Android 12 was released in October 2021, but the OS reached \"Platform Stability\" with Beta 4 in August 2021. Platform Stability means that the APIs and app-facing systems behaviors are finalized. Any changes to APIs or app-facing system behaviors must be included in the next Android version coinciding with a bump to the framework API level. Android 12\\'s API level was 31.  \\n\\nThen there\\'s the Quarterly Platform Releases (QPRs) each quarter (ie. every 3 months). Although Android 12 already reached Platform Stability, the \"Stability\" there doesn\\'t mean there aren\\'t bugs left to fix. There are always bugs left to be discovered, triaged, and then fixed in subsequent updates. Google supports an Android release with monthly security updates for about 3.5 years after its initial release, while any remaining non-security bug fixes in the platform generally get lumped together and released as part of the next QPR. Google generally releases 3 public QPRs until the next OS update. These QPRs can even include new features so long they don\\'t require a new API — but if those new features *did* require an API update, then the API level has to be bumped up (which then means Google has to decide whether to make targeting that API mandatory for devs on Google Play, OEMs have to decide whether to upgrade their devices to that, and a whole lot of other considerations come into play).  \\n\\nAndroid 12\\'s first QPR happened in December 2021. It was a pretty typical QPR with lots of bug fixes and some new features which you can read about [here.](https://blog.esper.io/android-dessert-bites-4-android-12-big-update-9649781/#what-s-new-in-android-12-qpr1) \\n\\nAndroid 12\\'s second QPR is a bit unusual because it came in the form of Android 12L. Android 12L is just a marketing name, though. But because it included API and behavior changes, it came up an API bump to 32.  \\n\\nWhich brings us to today. Today, Google announced a public beta program for Android 12\\'s third QPR. This is expected to launch in June 2022 (the last QPR was this Monday, March 7, and it\\'s a quarterly release cycle, after all). Google usually doesn\\'t do public beta tests of QPRs, instead developing and testing everything internally and then quietly releasing to AOSP.  \\n\\nI think the major software issues [that we saw with the Pixel 6 post-launch](https://blog.esper.io/android-dessert-bites-8-android-security-patch-conundrum-65197/) may have led Google to do this, but I can\\'t say for sure. Whatever the case, I\\'m happy that they\\'re finally doing public beta tests of QPRs. Google already tests the changes they introduce in QPRs internally, but opening up a beta means more people will be able to test and find bugs before the next platform release.  \\n\\nWhich brings me to \"Feature Drops\" and how they factor in. Pixel Feature Drops are quarterly updates like QPRs, but they encompass more than that. They generally bring an update to the platform + updates to various Google apps. Once a year, the major OS update (like Android 12) is even counted as a Pixel Feature Drop.  \\n\\nSo, in summary:\\n\\n* Android 12 (October 2021) = API level 31\\n* Android 12 QPR1 (December 2021) = API level 31\\n* Android 12 QPR2 (March 2022 - marketed as Android 12L) = API level 32\\n* Android 12 QPR3 (~June 2022) = API level 32\\n* Android 13 (~August-September 2022) = API level 33  \\n\\nAndroid 12 QPR3 won\\'t be anything special like QPR2/12L was, but for Pixel users, there may be other exciting additions/features that Google plans to add to their proprietary apps that they\\'ll roll out as part of the next Pixel Feature Drop in June 2022.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nPersonally, I think Google is making a mistake by saying that users are beta testing the \"June 2022 Feature Drop\". When people think of Pixel Feature Drops, I bet most people think of the new features in Google apps, not the underlying platform update (unless said platform update is major). Now, if Google were to start publicly beta testing the new Google app features ahead of their announcement in the June 2022 Pixel Feature Drop, then I\\'d think differently. But as it is, I think this is the wrong way to frame it.\\n\\nIt\\'d also be nice if Google actually posted what changes they\\'re working on for QPR3. [The release notes page](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/release-notes) is pretty barren right now. Kind of hard for users to test the beta without knowing what to look out for. I guess we\\'ll just have to wait for the AOSP code drop in June to find out what\\'s changed?',\n",

We had a teenage patient whose GCS was technically 7 (E1V1M5, to penlight crushing nail beds, vigorous sternal rub, and even let us straight cath), whose pupils would track up under his eyelids when I pulled his lids up. My attending said that eyes moving upwards was not a physiologic response and I wanted to confirm that. I've seen cases of status before where the eyes continuing to have nystagmus/involuntary movement was the giveaway, but I don't know enough about which types of eye movement are involuntary/physiologic and would love to know more.
